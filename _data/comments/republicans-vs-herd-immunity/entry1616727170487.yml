message: "Your calculation forgot to include the number of people who are immune due to previous infection.  That's around 30% of American adults, so you can reduce that supposed 33% of Republicans by at least 30%, to about 23%--77% of Repubs immune from vax or infection.  You need 73% immunity among Dems to get to 75%. Given the black and Hispanic reluctance rates, the Dems should manage at least 80% compliance, plus another 6% immunity from infections.  So 77% and 86% at the minimum gets us to 81%.  By the time voluntary vaccinations complete, even more will be infection-immune.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the arrogant dream of coerced vaccination--which would only be dreamt up by a authoritarian fool who lives in a tiny social/intellectual bubble and has never heard of backfire--is unnecessary after all.  By the way, Fauci is an outrageous liar, has been for decades (starting with HIV), continues to lie ad nauseam--and you quote him as an authority?  Embarrassing.  I can't tell if you're a Dunning-Kruger case or a Gell-Mann amnesia case."
