  Yay! I'm one week into dose 1. I've heard that pre-dosing with Tylenol - aka
  the somehow-rolls-off-your-tongue acetaminophen - blunts the discomfort with
  post-vaccine reaction, but I'm hesitant because of the argument that
  decreasing symptoms could also decrease immune system response. Not enough
  data, of course. :)
