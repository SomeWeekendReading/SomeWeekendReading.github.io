message: "Thanks for stopping by, Pablo!\r\n\r\nYour comment about pre-dosing with NSAIDs was something I was going to research for another post.  But your question prompted me to take care of it today, so I added a section above.\r\n\r\nIt turns out there _is_ enough data: pre-dosing with NSAIDs is a bad idea, but taking them the next day once side-effects have manifested is probably ok."
