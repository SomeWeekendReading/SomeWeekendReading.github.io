message: "Yes, that's right: the vaccine efficacy as measured in the clinical trials is a _population_ measure, not an individual one.  We can't distinguish between average risk (your alternative 1) vs subpopulation risk (your alternative 2).  \r\n\r\nMore about efficacy and confidence intervals [here](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-confidence-intervals/), complete with worked numerical examples, R scripts, plots, and lions &amp; tigers &amp; bears, oh my!  \r\n\r\nAnd BTW, the J&amp;J South African trials found [vastly different efficacy between the HIV+ and HIV- populations (49% for HIV+, 60% for HIV-)](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/jnj-vaccine-relatively-pretty/#added-2021-jan-30-derek-lowe-weighs-in), so we know that alternative 2 can in fact occur for people whose immune system has been messed up.
