message: "Coming up to my second jab next week (yay!), I found myself wondering about the nature of that 95%. I don't think it's a question that we can answer, given available data, but I can imagine that number manifesting in two different ways:\r\n\r\n1) Everybody gets immune defenses that are 95% effective - e.g. expose them 20 times, and on average the virus will get through once.\r\n\r\n2) 95% of the population gets bulletproof immune response, but 5% get nothing.\r\n\r\nI'm sure everyone's immune responses vary, so it's a combination of the two, but I can't help but wonder what that curve looks like."
