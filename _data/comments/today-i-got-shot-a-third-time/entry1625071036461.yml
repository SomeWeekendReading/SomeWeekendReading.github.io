message: "Thanks for the good wishes, Pablo!\r\n\r\nSo far, so good: really sore arm, pretty tired this morning, feeling like I'm a bit fragile.  I'll take that, in exchange for the reduced risk of the misery of shingles.\r\n\r\n2nd dose sometime between the end of August and December, so that'll probably be more \"exciting\" and I'll whine about it then."
