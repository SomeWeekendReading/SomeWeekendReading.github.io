message: "Fractal boundaries: consider this .\r\nWe generate the Mandelbrot set from z_n+1= (z_n )^2+c. You start with z_0 = 0, and iterate. YOu choose a value for c, .If the series does not diverge to infinity then c is in the set. Thus c=i is in the set. A problem: find a value of c near i  (say within a circle of radius <.01) such that this new value is in the set. And yet this value must exist because the set is connected."
