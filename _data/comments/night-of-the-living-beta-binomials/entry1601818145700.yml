message: "Oh man - I've not thought of beta binomials since surprisingly far back into the previous century! Perhaps the last millenium, even. :) \r\n\r\nBut yeah, the beta binomial feels like that scary girl we all (okay, most of us) once had a date with. Once. And we've totally forgotten about her and the way we weren't quite sure if she actually liked us or was planning to murder us and distribute our body parts in dumpsters around the city. Then we see her behind the counter at...wait - what were we talking about?\r\n\r\nBut thanks for this - it brought back some old memories of another life!\r\n\r\nAnd remember, as George Box said, \"All models are wrong. But some are useful.\" (I bet this would look great in Latin...)"
