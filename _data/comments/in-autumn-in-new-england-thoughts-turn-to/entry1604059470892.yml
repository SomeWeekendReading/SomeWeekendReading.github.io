message: "Yeah, the whole thing ignores air friction.  That will add a need for considerable extra muzzle velocity, detailed modeling of vorticity shedding along the rough pumpkin exterior, and the trajectory will no longer be parabolic (losing velocity due to friction in flight causes it to bend downward faster).  \r\n\r\nStill... pumpkins at 2300 ft altitude _do_ probably require cooperation of air traffic control!"
