message: "Wikipedia has surprisingly good coverage of [the variants of SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2).  \r\n\r\nAs of today, the WHO classifies Lambda (aka C.37) as a \"variant of interest\".  That's somewhat below the level of \"variant of concern\" that includes Delta (aka B.1.617.2).  \r\n\r\nThat's not just terminological wrangling, it's based on [transmissibility, morbitity, mortality, diagnostic evasion, antibody evasion, natural immunity evasion, vaccine evasion, and sensitivity in particular subpopulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2#Criteria_for_notability).  It's a pretty complicated decision tree, but based on real stuff that will kill people if we ignore it.  \r\n\r\nIt appears that [Lambda _might_ have some vaccine resistance, and spread faster than Alpha or Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2#Lambda_(lineage_C.37)).  But the vaccine evasion has not yet been proven.  And to my (_partial_) knowledge, Delta spreads faster anyway, so it will out-compete Lambda.  \r\n\r\n[Delta appears to be the most easily spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2#Delta_(lineage_B.1.617.2)), and has hence taken over the UK.  As of today, it is more than 50% of the new infections in the US.  That's worrisome.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the evidence seems to be that [the vaccines (especially mRNA) are effectve against all _current_ variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2#Differential_vaccine_effectiveness).  If we continue to breed new variants by having large, continguous populations of unvaccinated people, _this will change for the worse_.  \r\n\r\nAlmost all the new infections are among the unvaccinated.  In Israel, they showed Pfizer was about 60 &ndash; 70% effective against Delta infection, but 99.5% effective against hospitalization and death.  If you're vaccinated, you _might_ get infected but you probably will shake it off at home.  If you're _not_ vaccinated, you may die.  If you're unvaccinated, that should be _terrifying_.  Maybe terrified enough to get vaccinated?"
