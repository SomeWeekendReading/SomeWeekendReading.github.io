message: "The pattern time I byword Gail Dines speak, at a colloquy in Boston, she moved the audience to tears with her portrait of the problems caused next to porn, and provoked laughter with her spicy observations about pornographers themselves. Activists in the audience were newly inspired, and men at the result – sundry of whom had not viewed porn as a complication first – queued up afterwards to guaranty their support. The exhibition highlighted Dines's iffy charisma and the fact that, since the undoing of Andrea Dworkin, she has risen to that most difficult and exciting of public roles: the great's foremost anti-pornography campaigner. \r\n \r\n[url=https://xxxbdsmvideos.com]xxxbdsmvideos[/url]"
