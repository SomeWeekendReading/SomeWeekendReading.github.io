message: "No, unfortunately I do not.  \r\n\r\nThe sources cited above just give the total number of cloture motions in each session of congress, not the party filing the motion.  One _could_, of course, get such information from a detailed reading of the minutes.  It's _probably_ available somewhere, but I just needed the total number of filings per session and the party in charge of the senate and presidency.\r\n\r\nBut you know... that might be something worth writing to your senator about.  It will be read by a staffer, but probably the staffers know where all the goods are."
