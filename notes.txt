Notes on blogging tech.

* DONE: Git ritual for publishing updates:
  - edit/create files (but not delete, see git rm below)
  - git status
    reports what has changed wrt github
  - git add file
    git rm  file
    adds/removes changed files to the staging area
  - git commit -F -
    commits, reading commit comment from stdin in weird emacs shell
    (or combine add & commit in git commit -a -F -)
  - git push -u origin master
    pushes changes up to github, where site will be rebuilt
  - git status
    to check whether it all worked
  - use git clone to re-download from github to the local machine

* DONE: Domain:
  - Recommendation of https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-start-a-blog/ to use domain.com,
    with promo code QUICKSPROUT.  Buy domain privacy so people can't find your personal
    name.  Do automatic renewal.  Skip the rest.
  - someweekendreading.blog $122.03 for 5 years, with discount from QUICKSPROUT promo code.
  - Need to configure www.someweekendreading.blog as an alias/a record?  What's cname?
  - Need to figure out configuration, and make www subdomain, but it seems to be working?
  - For now appears to be 66.96.162.140
  - To see what the DNS thinks of the domain:
    $ dig someweekendreading.blog www.someweekendreading.blog
  - So... ANAME the apex domain to the www domain; CNAME the www domain to sgr000.github.io
    Domain.com doesn't allow ANAME, so have to do 4 A records?
    185.199.108.153
    185.199.109.153
    185.199.110.153
    185.199.111.153
  - Got https working: check the appropriate box on Github (ignore domain.com!), remove
    all http: links for mixed content, and wait a bit.
    URL is now: https://www.someweekendreading.blog/
  - Looks like www.someweekendreading.blog forward to someweekendreading.blog and not the
    other way around, but that may be a Chrome "abbreviation" in the URL box?  (Yes:
    Firefox, of course, does The Right Thing and displays https://www...)
  - DNS opinion of what's what:
    $ dig someweekendreading.blog www.someweekendreading.blog

* DONE: Get tags working without a plugin (https://github.com/mynux/jekyll-hashtags),
  because github won't do that.  Instead:
  https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20add,of%20Github%20default%20jekyll%20plugins.

* DONE: Add sitemap (can't use plugin, have to manually make sitemap.xml script)
  (https://davidensinger.com/2013/11/building-a-better-sitemap-xml-with-jekyll/)
  Optional frontmatter to add to posts:
  sitemap:
    lastmod: 2014-01-23
    priority: 0.7
    changefreq: 'monthly'
    exclude: 'yes'

* DONE:
  - Jekyll docs: https://jekyllrb.com/
  - github markdown cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
  - Tool on net to resize images: https://resizeimage.net/

* DONE: text wrapping around images: 
  https://allwebco-templates.com/support/S_textwrap.htm#:~:text=You%20might%20want%20to%20have,border%20using%20CSS%20border%20code.

  The following code uses css float:left. Add the image code below just before the text that
  you want to have wrap. Place an image named "yourimage.jpg" in your "picts"
  folder. Select, copy, and paste the following code into your HTML page.  Add your wrapping
  text paragraph after the image code. Edit to float left or right, and adjust the margins
  and border styles to your requirements. Note: Margin code is in order; top, right, bottom,
  left.

  <a href="picts/yourimage.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="picts/yourimage.jpg" height="100" width="100" alt="Image alt text" title="Image title" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

* DONE: feed works with theoldreader.com.  Yay!  Now blog link is stored in my feeds.

TODOs: These should be GitHub issues!

*** How to do pushes from my laptop, when SomeWeekendReading now owns it?  Supply SWR
    credentials on command line somehow?  (And then delete myself as a collaborator.)
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29776439/username-and-password-in-command-for-git-push
    This prompts for the password:
    git push https://YOUR_GIT_USERNAME@github.com/YOUR_GIT_USERNAME/yourGitFileName.git

To clear history:
    ## Delete all the old history in local clone
    rm -rf .git
    ## Make this directory a new repository
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ## Connect it to the remot at github
    git remote add origin git@github.com:SomeWeekendReading/someweekendreading.github.io.git
    ## Change the connect method from SSH to HTTPS
    git remote -v
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/SomeWeekendReading/someweekendreading.github.io.git
    git remote -v
    ## Push everything up to the remote repo
    ## *** Requires to be a collaborator, or supply SWR credentials somehow?
    git push --mirror --force

*** Comments:
    https://staticman.net/
    https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html
    - Need GitHub bot account
    - Store personal access token, once generated, in BitWarden under the GitHub bot account
      Same with RSA keypair.
    - Have to keep _config.yml and staticman.yml in synch because some info is recorded in
      both places (not DRY!)
    - 

*** Submit sitemap.xml to Google, to get us crawled
    - https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome (while logged in as SomeWeekendReadingEditor)
      Instructed to add a TXT entry to DNS with a certain google-site-verification value,
      to prove ownership. Did that, waiting for it to propagate. (the www subdomain)
    - *** Is google looking at the apex domain, whereas I put the verification on www subdomain?
      Moved the TXT property to @; wait overnight to see if it verifies.
      That worked!
    - Submitted https://www.someweekendreading.blog/sitemap.xml
      Google retrieved it.
    - Now what?

*** Google Analytics & AdSense, once we have some readers
    https://flipdazed.github.io/blog/website/google-adsense-and-google-analytics

*** Install jekyll locally, so I can debug locally before pushing out to the world (see README.md)
  - Needs Ruby 2.5.0 or higher; I have only 2.3.7p456, so have to upgrade.
  - Also need to update RubyGems
1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at https://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

*** Test math: kramdown/mathjax?

*** Put footer icons at the TOP of the page, RHS opposite the permalinks?

*** Make tag collection scan non-post files like about.md, and 404.md.
    *** 1st attempt not working:
    Prob not working because tagpage.html assumes it can ref post.date, post.title, post.description
    An ordinary page has a title, but no date and no description?  Add to YML?  (didn't
    work either)

*** change archive.html to tags.html
*** R script to gather all tags, make associated .md files
*** Add a side table of hashtags, maybe a word cloud, instead of list @ bottom?
*** Convert sitemap to an HTML page & permalink it?

*** Copyright notice on each page?

*** Read Pro GIT

*** footer badges: prepared in Emacs, generated by Jekyll, valid HTML, valid CSS
    And, of course... check the validity!  Change generator if it fails.
    Does it claim to be HTML5?

*** Fiddle with font sizes to make everything more compressed

*** Verify that mail account is still forwarding emails to me... seems not?

*** mailto: link doesn't work?  (Both Firefox and Chrome; in Safari clicks on the mailto
    link cause the browser to bury itself and do nothing.)  Reloaded GMail, it asked to be
    allowed to open mail links which I allowed, and now it works?!
    AMBIGUOUS...

  Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in

  her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on
  unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been,
  is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited
  tombs. -- George Eliot, _Middlemarch_, of the character Dorothea
