[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe), "What's that stupid avatar
on your blog?"  It's a reminder that even simple problems show infinite complexity if you
look closely enough.  

Suppose you want to look for the cube roots of unity in the complex $z$ plane.  That is,
you're looking for the roots of $z^3 - 1 = 0$.  The answer is pretty simple; there are 3
roots distributed equally about the unit circle:

$$
\begin{align*}
  z &=& 1               \\
  z &=& e^{2 \pi i / 3} \\
  z &=& e^{4 \pi i / 3} \\
\end{align*}
$$
