title: A beautiful vaccine: a look into the Pfizer/BioNTech FDA EUA submission package

Ok, nobody asked me this time, because for once I got out ahead of them.  Pfizer/BioNTech 
submitted an EUA package to the FDA.  What's it look like?  

## First patient vaccinated in UK today

First, we have to note with great satisfaction that Pfizer/BioNTech submitted an EUA to
the regulatory authorities in the UK, who have granted it.  Vaccinations began _today_,
starting with an elderly grandmother. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> (She was described
as "a former jewelry shop assistant" (though, to their credit, not by the venerable Beeb,
cited below).  This bugs me: surely her career is not relevant data here?  Why must we be
so reductionist about people's _jobs_, rather than the fact that they are _people_?  We
are better than economic "cannon fodder"! <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>)  

## Pfizer/BioNTech FDA submission for EUA in the US  

With that out of the way, we note also with great satisfaction that Pfizer/BioNTech have
sumbitted their EUA ("emergency use authorization") application to the FDA.  The advisory
committee meets 2020-Dec-10 (Moderna's is on 2020-Dec-17), and will make a recommendation
to the FDA, which will then decide.  There is of course a process for this, but I don't
know what it is: _this has never been done before._ That's the nature of emergencies, to
be bad surprises.  

Still, I have every hope the process will work, at least 2 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and
Moderna) will get US approval before the end of 2020, and vaccinations will likely start
next week with health care workers.  (A family member who is an active health care worker
has already received the letter saying when &amp; where to show up to get whichever vaccine
makes it there first.)  

A pleasant side-effect of an FDA submission is that a lot of data suddenly becomes
public.  Cases in point today are:  
- The 92-page package submitted by Pfizer/BioNTech to the FDA. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  
- The 53-page reanalysis of the same data by FDA staff. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

An FDA reanalysis of data submitted with a drug application is quite normal.  Indeed, when
your humble Weekend Editor was first starting out in pharma research, a senior scientist
explained to me that the first thing the FDA does is throw out your conclusion, the second
is they reanalyze your data, and the third thing is to compare their conclusions with
yours.  If there's a match, then you get a committe hearing; if not, you get various
levels of frowns.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-08-beautiful-vaccines-case-rates.png" width="400" height="265" alt="Pfizer/BioNTech: case rates in treatment &amp; control arms" title="Pfizer/BioNTech: case rates in treatment &amp; control arms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Obviously, there's a _lot_ of stuff in there, going over the results in excruciating
detail.  I've only excruciated a tiny bit of it, but I want to call attention to
this_beautiful_ plot (p. 58 of the Pfizer/BioNTech submission, p. 30 of the FDA reanalysis).  
- The horizontal axis is time.  The first injection occured on day 1, and the second on
  day 21.  
- The vertical axis is the frequency of COVID-19 cases seen, as a fraction of the number
  of subjects in each treatment arm.  
- The open squares and circles are COVID-19 cases; the dark ones (with an "S" inscribed in
  them) are severe cases.  
- The red curve is the control arm, and teh blue curve is the treatment arm (i.e., the
  vaccine).  
  
Note that the red arm rises more or less linearly in time.  That means there is a constant
probability/unit time of being infected.  This is the background case rate we would like
to escape.

The blue arm, though: it shows more or less nothing up until about day 12, and then goes
almost absolutely flat.  It completely _squashes_ the case rate to almost nothing.  Yes,
there are a couple cases; but remember there are about 15,000 people in each arm, so the
_probability_ of getting infected is driven down to almost nothing.  

This is the first news that has made me hopeful in a long while.  If it's approved &ndash;
and it damn well better be! &ndash; then we can look forward to being vaccinated soon.
First health care workers and nursing home residents, then essential workers and the
elderly, then everybody.  (Pediatric and pregnant trials are still ongoing.)
