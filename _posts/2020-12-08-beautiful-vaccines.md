Ok, nobody asked me this time, because for once I got out ahead of them.  Pfizer/BioNTech 
submitted an EUA package to the FDA.  What's it look like?  

## First patient vaccinated in UK today  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-08-beautiful-vaccines-uk-first-patient.jpg" width="313" height="400" alt="BBC: first COVID-19 patient vaccinated in UK" title="BBC: first COVID-19 patient vaccinated in UK" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
First, we have to note with great satisfaction that Pfizer/BioNTech submitted an EUA to
the regulatory authorities in the UK, who have granted it.  Vaccinations began _today_,
starting with a 91-year-old grandmother. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

She was described as "a former jewelry shop assistant" (though, to their credit, not by
the venerable Beeb, cited below).  This bugs me: surely her career is not relevant data
here?  Why must we be so reductionist about people's _jobs_, rather than the fact that
they are _people_?  We are better than economic "cannon fodder"! <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

Still, cannon fodder or not&hellip; she's _vaccinated_ now.  (Or will be, upon her second
dose 21 days from now and another 7 days to build up final immunity.)  

## Pfizer/BioNTech FDA submission for EUA in the US  

With that out of the way, we note also with great satisfaction that Pfizer/BioNTech have
sumbitted their EUA ("emergency use authorization") application to the FDA.  The advisory
committee meets this Thursday, 2020-Dec-10 (Moderna's is on 2020-Dec-17), and will make a
recommendation to the FDA, which will then decide.  There is of course a process for this,
but I don't know what it is: _this has never been done before._ That's the nature of
emergencies, to be bad surprises.  

Still, I have every hope the process will work, at least 2 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and
Moderna) will get US approval before the end of 2020, and vaccinations will likely start
next week with health care workers.  (A family member who is an active health care worker
has already received the letter saying when &amp; where to show up to get whichever vaccine
makes it there first.)  

A pleasant side-effect of an FDA submission is that a lot of data suddenly becomes
public.  Cases in point today are:  
- The 92-page package submitted by Pfizer/BioNTech to the FDA. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  
- The 53-page reanalysis of the same data by FDA staff. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

An FDA reanalysis of data submitted with a drug application is quite normal.  Indeed, when
your humble Weekend Editor was first starting out in pharma research, a senior scientist
explained to me that the first thing the FDA does is throw out your conclusion, the second
is they reanalyze your data, and the third thing is to compare their conclusions with
yours.  If there's a match, then you get a committe hearing; if not, you get a frown at
various levels of intensity, depending on how bad the screw-up is and how fast you correct
or withdraw the application.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-08-beautiful-vaccines-case-rates.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="Pfizer/BioNTech: case rates in treatment &amp; control arms" title="Pfizer/BioNTech: case rates in treatment &amp; control arms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Obviously, there's a _lot_ of stuff in there, going over the results in excruciating
detail.  I've only excruciated a tiny bit of it, but I want to call attention to
this _beautiful_ plot (p. 58 of the Pfizer/BioNTech submission, p. 30 of the FDA reanalysis).  
- The horizontal axis is time.  The first injection occurred on day 1, and the second on
  day 21.  
- The vertical axis is the frequency of COVID-19 cases seen, as a fraction of the number
  of subjects in each treatment arm.  
- The open squares and circles are COVID-19 cases; the dark ones (with an "S" inscribed in
  them) are severe cases.  
- The red curve is the control arm, and the blue curve is the treatment arm (i.e., the
  vaccine).  
  
Note that the red arm rises more or less linearly in time.  That means there is a constant
probability/unit time, or rate, of being infected.  This is the background case rate we
would like to escape.  

The blue arm, though: it shows more or less no protection up until about day 12, and then goes
almost absolutely flat.  It completely _squashes_ the case rate to almost nothing.  Yes,
there are a couple cases; but remember there are about 15,000 people in each arm, so the
probability per unit time, or rate, of getting infected is driven down to almost nothing.  

This is the first news that has made me hopeful in a long while.  If it's approved &ndash;
and it damn well _better_ be! &ndash; then we can look forward to being vaccinated soon.
First health care workers and nursing home residents, then essential workers and the
elderly, then everybody.  (Pediatric and pregnant trials are still ongoing.)  

## Meanwhile, back in the Republican clown car  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-08-beautiful-vaccines-decline-trump-summit.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="STAT News: Pfizer/BioNTech decline Trump 'summit'" title="STAT News: Pfizer/BioNTech decline Trump 'summit'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Meanwhile, _STAT News_ reports <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> that Trump invited both
Pfizer and Moderna to the White House for a "Vaccine Summit".  Since everything Trump
touches dies, one should be _very dubious_ about this, as it will likely be a stunt for
Trump to claim personal credit.  ("I came up with vaccines that people didn't think we'd
have for five years", as Trump said in a Fox News interview.  No, I will not link to Fox
News.  You can watch right-wing propaganda on your own time.)  Notably, Pfizer refused to
take government money for this, so the claim of Trump credit is&hellip; _peculiar_, 
emphasis on "liar".  

Both companies wisely declined to be used thusly.

title="Charlie Pierce on blockhead anti-vax hearings" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px
3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/> Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are not to be
outdone: they're _actively undermining_ public confidence in vaccines by holding hearings
starring an prominent anti-vax
quack. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  

That would be Dr. Jane M. Orient, executive director of the _Association of American
Physicians and Surgeons_.  As Charlie Pierce describes them:
> Before you get too impressed by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, you should know that it's pretty much a wingnut-welfare hiring hall for people who think the AMA is run by a cabal of Trotskyite neurosurgeons.  

Some of their positions, according to Olga Khazan writing in _The Atlantic_ <sup
id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>, are utter howlers:  
- Mandatory vaccination is "equivalent to human experimentation"  
- Medicare is "evil"  
- After measles broke out at Disneyland, they questioned the safety of measles vaccines  
- Abortions cause breast cancer  
- Obama was covertly hypnotizing people with his speeches  
- HIV doesn't cause AIDS  
- There is no health reason to stop smoking  

Now, with positions like that, why do they even hold medical licenses, let alone testify
before the Senate _against vaccines in the midst of a pandemic_?  And why do half of us encourage
so many Republican politicians who enable this sort of crap?  

Why does the frail gleam of a ray of good news have to be accompanied by right-wing
self-destructive idiocy?  

[_O tempora, o mores_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_tempora,_o_mores!), indeed!
