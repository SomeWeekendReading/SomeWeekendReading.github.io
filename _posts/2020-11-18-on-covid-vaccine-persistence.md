title: On COVID vaccine protection persistence

Everybody's worried about how long the protection from a COVID vaccine will last, whether
there can be reinfections, and so on.  How much do we actually know about that as of
now?  

Unsurprisingly, very little.  Really the only way to know is to vaccinate a bunch of
people and watch them for a couple of years.  The animal data looked pretty good before
the clinical trials, but it _always_ looks good or the human trial wouldn't have been
allowed to start.  

Over at [_In the Pipeline_](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline), Derek Lowe wrote about
this <sup id="fn1a">[[reference 1](#fn1)]</sup> (among other things like side-effects,
efficacy across different populations, logistics of the rollout, and other really
interesting stuff).  

That leads to the paper by Dan, _et al._ <sup id="fn2a">[[reference 2](#fn2)]</sup> which
hit the preprint server ("not yet peer reviewed") in the last couple days.  Lowe notes that
this seems to be the largest and most detailed study of post-viral-infection immunity in the entire
medical literature!  It basically says that at 6 months post-infection:
- spike antibodies were still abundant,
- the spike-specific B cells that form immune memory were still abundant,
- the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that do the actual work were slowly decaying with a half life
  of about 3-5 months, as one would expect of an immune system slowly standing down after
  an infection.
That's the good news.

The other, more frustrating news that I get from that paper is the _intense variability_
across patients and across time, as shown in their Figure 1, excerpted here.  There are
going to be a _lot_ of different kinds of response seen in the population, possibly
including re-infection.  People will probably get really confused &amp; angry about it.
(Though, to be fair, "confused &amp; angry" does seems to be the _zeitgeist_.)  

## Bottom line  

Overall, this is looking like good, solid vaccine response with persistence of the things
we think matter for a long time.  Lowe reminds us of the following hopeful historical
fact:  

> For what it’s worth, there are patients who survived the 1918 influenza pandemic who had B cells that [still responded](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848880/) <sup id="fn3a">[[reference 3](#fn3)]</sup> with fresh neutralizing antibodies after over 90 years, so they can be rather hardy.  

So&hellip; yeah, 90 years.  I'll take that.  Let's hope we can _all_ get that.
