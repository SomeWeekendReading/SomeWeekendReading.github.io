Today the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trial gave its _first interim_ readout: 90% efficacy.
This is unabashedly good news.

This is an _interim_ readout from Pfizer &amp; BioNTech <sup id="fn1a">[[reference 1](#fn1)]</sup>,
meaning it's an early look at the data using simplified analyses.  And it's just a press
release: a bit of corporate propaganda to which your Weekend Editor has allergies, instead
of peer-reviewed science.  But still&hellip; 90% efficacy is very good news, indeed!  

I'm very slightly surprised that Moderna wasn't the first to do an interim readout, since
they looked slightly ahead.  But, a lot of this sort of thing is down to random chance, so
that doesn't mean much.  What _is_ meaningful: all the vaccines target the same spike
protein, and what's more Moderna and Pfizer both target it with an mRNA vaccine.  So, if
one vaccine works, they're all likely to work (to varying degrees, in varying populations,
but that's a good thing).  

And&hellip; mRNA vaccines will have been proven to work.  That's another good thing, since
they can be developed _very_ quickly.  

## Cautionary notes  

- Being an _interim_ readout, there is a chance that the final results will weaken the
  result.  
- We're talking about a study with $N = 43,538$ participants, and we've thus far seen only
  94 COVID cases in both treatment & control arms, total.  That is a very small fraction
  of the total (about 0.2%)!  
- The initial study design called for an interim readout at 32 cases, and while the FDA
  was negotiating a protocol amendment to increase that to 62 cases, the number of cases 
  climbed up to 94.  We really have let political dysfunction lead into uncontrolled
  spread.  
- The final readout will be at 164 cases, and that is expected to happen sometime in late
  November.  The bad news is uncontrolled spread; the good news is that makes it easy to
  run the trial and get a fast readout.  That's a bad trade-off, but here we are.  
- Protection looks like it will last at least a year.  Possibly longer, but even so, it's
  acceptable to get an annual booster shot until the virus is stamped out of human
  circulation.  
- Strangely, Pence tried to claim to day that the Trump administrations Operation Warp
  Speed helped; Pfizer was quick to deny that they were ever part of that, nor had they
  ever taken money from the Trump administration for this.  So, at least that got slapped
  down quickly.  
- The required safety data is not yet in hand.  We want to see at least 2 months of safety
  data, for at least half the participants.  Even that is ok for a smallish population to
  be vaccinated, but thin ice if you're going to vaccinate billions.  After all, if you
  have a billion patients, then one-in-a-million events are going to crop up about 1,000
  times.  
- The vaccine requires an onerous cold chain of -70C freezers.  That's going to be
  hideously difficult in most of the world, where you take the vaccine out of the -70C
  freezer, dry ice pack it, and from that moment you're on a short timeline with the clock
  ticking away the minutes until you get it into a patient.  I have literally no idea how
  that can work in the developing world; even in the US, Europe, and Japan it's difficult
  to imagine working outside the big cities.  
- Doses are limited.  It won't be available to average citizens until maybe mid next year,
  optimistically?  And then it takes at least a month to get both doses and get the
  immunity built up after the second dose.  So... isolation is the rule of the day for at
  least 8 more months.  
  
## Remember the good news  
  
But at least we have preliminary evidence that it's _possible_ to make a coronavirus
vaccine.  

I won't go into the details here.  You can read the Pfizer/BioNTech press release in
