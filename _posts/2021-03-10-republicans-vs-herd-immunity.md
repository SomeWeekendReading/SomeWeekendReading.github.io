If a large enough clade of US persons refuse COVID-19 vaccination, herd immunity may never
be reached.  Right now in the US, that clade seems to be White Republicans.  (World-wide,
it's of course more complicated.)  

## Vaccine hesitancy in the US by subgroups 

[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) what I thought about vaccine
hesitancy in various groups, and how that would affect our attempt to reach herd
immunity.  

Everybody talks about Blacks, who actually have pretty good, rational reasons to
think the medical system doesn't have their best interests at heart.  But, as we wrote
[in a previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}/i-guess-i-like-dolly-parton/#whats-that-got-to-do-with-covid-19-vaccines), 
that's a bit of a red herring according to _Axios_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

!["Axios: White Republican vaccine hesitancy"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-08-i-guess-i-like-dolly-parton-axios.jpg "Axios: White Republican vaccine hesitancy")

We see that the most problematic clade is White Republicans, not Blacks or Latinos.  In
fact, the Black and Latino vaccine resistance has been trending downward over time, with a
nice step down on the day vaccinations started.  White Republicans, on the other hand, had
a _step up_ in vaccine resistance when vaccines came out, and no noticeable downward trend
(red curve).  So if you really want to combat resistance and get to general immunity,
White Republicans are where you have to start.  

That's why I was so impressed with Dolly Parton's vaccination video (aside from the
intimidating new phrase "chicken squat"): her fan demographic skews white, rural, and
Republican, so her message was _exactly_ on target.  


## Is that your only evidence?  

As St Thomas Aquinas (or possibly St Augustine?) is alleged to have said, 
["hominem unius libri timeo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_unius_libri) 
(I fear the man of one book, i.e., someone with narrow views likely to be fanatical).  So
do we have multiple sources beyond _Axios_ above?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-10-republicans-vs-herd-immunity-wapo-fishnet-mask.jpg" width="400" height="309" alt="WaPo: malicious compliance fishnet mask at CPAC" title="WaPo: malicious compliance fishnet mask at CPAC" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Unfortunately, yes.  

From a _Washington Post_ article by Dan Diamond comes the
disappointing news that almost 1/3 of Republicans say the "definitely won't" get
vaccinated. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  The article reports on a number of
interviews with some _very_ peculiar people subscribing to various dingbat ideas about
vaccines.  

My first reaction was "How can anybody be that _stupid?_ "  But then, I looked at the photo
at the top of the article.  It shows a knucklehead at CPAC showing off his "fishnet mask",
i.e., it allows him to claim to be masked but makes the mask utterly useless.  This is
what's called _malicious compliance_, i.e., technically obeying the mask-wearing rule
while contemptibly endangering everyone.  So&hellip; the Well of Stupid is deep indeed.  


## The critical question  

Ok, so some people are self-destructively stupid.  But does that really endanger others?
Are there enough of them to mess up herd immunity so this _never_ goes away?  

First, let's get a handle on the size of the problem.  We've seen _Axios_ claim 56% of
White Republicans, and now the _WaPo_ claim 33% of all Republicans.  Let's go with the
lower figure, just to make sure I'm not stacking the deck here.  Let's say about half the
US is Republican (alas), so that means we have a hard-core vaccine resistance population
of about 0.33 * 0.50 * 100% = 16.5%.  

Second, let's look at 
[the mathematical basis for herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity#Theoretical_basis).
Everything depends on the parameter $R_0$, the basic reproduction number of the disease:
the number of new infections caused by each infected person in conditions of perfect
mixing.  Let $S$ be the fraction of the population who are susceptible.  At the critical
point where herd immunity sets in,  

$$
R_0 \cdot S \leq 1
$$

Now let $p$ be the probability a person accepts the vaccine.  Then $S = 1 - p$.  Plugging
that into the previous equation and solving for $p$, we get:  

$$
p \geq 1 - \frac{1}{R_0}
$$

Now, for COVID-19, the best estimates for $R_0$ range around 
2.5 &ndash; 4. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
The B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants might be quite a bit higher, so the upper end of that
range is the thing we have to shoot for.  That means we need 100% * (1 - 1/4) = 75% of the
population vaccinated to get to herd immunity.  

So&hellip; we have 25% or less slack in the population who can resist the vaccine and not
mess it up for the rest of us.  Having 17% of the population being vaccine resisting
Republicans isn't _immediately_ fatal.  But _only if we get near-perfect vaccination
acceptance everywhere else, and the new variants aren't even more virulent._  They're
burning up the margin of safety in the name of&hellip; being knuckleheads?  


## Consequences  

There is precedent for what to do here: [Jacobson v Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts) (197 U.S. 11 (1905))
is a Supreme Court precedent saying that yes, it _is_ possible for the state to use police
powers to compel vaccination (smallpox, in this case).  It's not some dusty old legal
peculiarity, either.  It gets frequently used as a precedent because it both strengthens
_and limits_ police power: you can be arrested &amp; fined for not being vaccinated, but
the cops can't just hold you down and jab you against your will.  

And we haven't even begun to think about the developing world!  Unless COVID is eradicated
_everywhere_, it will continue to evolve mutant forms that are more virulent or more
deadly.  Worst of all would be an "escape mutation" that evades the existing vaccines;
then we'd have to start all over again.  So we really have to vaccinate pretty much
_everybody_: [nobody is safe until everybody is safe](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/why-no-one-safe-until-everyone-safe-during-pandemic).  

Sometimes, that's what it takes to eradicate a pandemic.  Just think of what the modern
debased US political reactions would be&hellip; It's already _almost_ that bad, where
people refusing to mask up are assumed to be Republicans, and that widely viewed as an
occasion for shame:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    I ordered pizza the other day. When the delivery guy arrived, I went to the door. My
	15 yo daughter told me to "mask up!" "Why? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated" I asked. "We don‚Äôt
	want to freak out the delivery guy, but, more importantly, we don‚Äôt want him to think
	we are Republicans."

##  Eagerly awaiting vaccination  

Here at Chez Weekend, your humble Weekend Editor has gotten the first shot, and is eagerly
anticipating the second.  The Weekend Editrix, young girl that she is, is also eagerly
awaiting when our state guidelines lower the age limit to her age.  

So everybody wants (or should want) the vaccine.  

Now, I'm not really a fan of Randy Rainbow&hellip; but once in a while his brand of
silliness helps us appreciate the surreal nature of the situation.  I do actually remember
the song
["Mr. Sandman" by the Chordettes from 1958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX45pYvxDiA).
(Mostly because my older brother &amp; sister were listening to popular music
at the time when I was a wee sprout.)  So&hellip; "Mr. Biden, bring my vaccine":
