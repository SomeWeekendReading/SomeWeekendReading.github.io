Today was a good day: with the inauguration (and the constitutional mandate behind it) at
12:01pm, Biden &amp; Harris and a Democratic congress (barely) are back in charge.  

With respect to the solemnities of the afternoon's inauguration, we pass over in silence.
May decisions be made in wisdom, kindness, and respect.  

But with respect to the absurdities of the morning's departure of the previous&hellip;
person, we have somewhat to say.  (The gracious may observe _de mortuis nihil nisi bonum_,
but with respect to this&hellip; person&hellip; here at Chez Weekend we are not entirely
gracious.)  May he remain far from us, and have his misdeeds well
and truly exposed.

Furthermore, we have some suggestions for his travelling musical accompaninment.  They
offer, respectively, our wishes for his speedy travel elsewhere, an assessment of the
community sentiment, how much we wish to remember him, and some comments upon his likely legacy.  

Best wishes to the prosecutors of the Southern District of New York.
