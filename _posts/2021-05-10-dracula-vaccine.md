Romania has one of the highest vaccine hesitancy rates in Europe, around 50%.  They're
starting to get&hellip; _creative._  

## Leverage what you got

Now most non-Romanians, when asked about Romania will struggle a bit to name something
famous about the country.  Many will, however, eventually come up with the Dracula legends.
So&hellip; if that's what you've got, then leverage it to solve your vaccine hesitancy
problem!

From the venerable _BBC_ comes a story of just that.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
Apparently, visitors to the 14th century castle alleged to have belonged to Vlad Tepes are being
offered the Pfizer vaccine as well.  

The plan is an interesting move, from the point of view of marketing psychology: show up
on a weekend in May, get a vaccination, and then get free admission to the _exhibit of
medieval torture instruments._ I've heard of people offering free food or beer, but never
torture instruments.  I guess the fans of Dracula are a select bunch.  I wonder what the
Pfizer marketing department thinks of this?  

You kinda gotta admire the purity of it, if nothing else.  

What I want to know is: do they do it with 2 needles in the side of your neck?  You know,
for realism.
