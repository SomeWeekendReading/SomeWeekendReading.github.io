Today Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen announced the interim readout (not final numbers!)
of their adenovirus-vector based COVID-19 vaccine: 72% efficacy in the US,
down to 57% efficacy in South Africa.  We previously described the 
[Pfizer/BioNTech]({{ site.baseurl }}/beautiful-vaccines/)
and [Moderna/Lonza]({{ site.baseurl }}/beautiful-vaccines-2/) 
vaccines as "beautiful"; this is "relatively pretty".  Pretty enough to do some good in
the world, though.  


## We __hate__ press releases!  

Here at Chez Weekend, we _absolutely hate_ corporate attempts to do science by press
release.  So there's some gritting of teeth going on here, grudgingly reporting on the
preliminary readout of JnJ's COVID-19 vaccine, by press release.  In fact, as of this
morning, scouring some of the news venues with better science reporting yielded a number
of articles reporting on the press release, but _never citing the press release itself!_  

Indeed, a cursory search of the JnJ web site didn't turn it up either, when you'd think
that would be the _only thing on the front page_.  (Perhaps it will turn up later?)  So
we're pretty frustrated here, reporting not only on a press release instead of actual
scientific data (let alone peer review), but also reporting on hearsay!  


## But when that's all you can get&hellip; you just have to grit your teeth

Stunningly, JnJ are apparently willing to release important information like this _orally,
without having already written up the report._ Let's just say our confidence is not
high: normally, this sort of crap would earn a snub from us.  

But&hellip; gritted teeth.  At least it's not 
[as bad as AstraZeneca/Oxford]({{ site.baseurl }}/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-readout/) was.
When they file for an EUA with the FDA (probably in February), we'll have to take a
close look at their filing docs.  It does smack of upper management who are clueless about
how science works, though.  

Still&hellip; here at Chez Weekend we read &amp; summarize the silly, not-yet-scientific
reports _so you don't have to._  Our sources for today are an article by Matthew Herper in
the quite reliable _STAT News_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, a _New York Times_
article by the formidable Carl Zimmer and colleagues <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, and
just to show we don't _completely_ ignore the mainstream media, a CNBC article by Berkeley
Lovelace Jr. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

## Synthesizing the reports  

### JnJ vaccine mechanism  

This is a _viral vector_ vaccine: they take an existing virus and engineer it so that it
can't reproduce, and give it the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  That means the
virus can infect 1 cell, 1 time, no more.  The victim cell then starts cranking out a few
viral proteins, though not enough to assemble a complete virus (neither vector nor
SARS-CoV-2).  The spike protein gets displayed on the cell surface, and the immune system
goes happily nuts forming defenses.  

The viral vector here is Ad26, a somewhat ordinary adenovirus rather like a common cold
virus.  That's nice, in that the vector virus even if it were to (somehow) get out of
hand, would at worst give you a cold.  On the other hand, if you're already immune to
Ad26, your immune system might make you _also resistant to the vaccine_.  It also
complicates the case for giving a second "booster" dose, about which more later.  

No viral vector vaccine has ever been approved in the US up to now.  But one has been
[approved in Europe last July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_vaccine#Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo):
JnJ's vaccine against [Ebola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola).  Given how utterly
_nasty_ a hemorrhagic fever Ebola is, that's a _good thing._  The Ebola vaccine also uses Ad26
as its vector virus, so we have considerable safety data on the use of Ad26 as a vaccine vector.
That should inspire some confidence!  

Also, [the Russian Sputnik V vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_V_COVID-19_vaccine)
(also [known as Гам-КОВИД-Вак]({{ site.baseurl }}/moderna-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/#fn2)) 
against COVID is an adenovirus vaccine (using both Ad5 and Ad26, for reasons I haven't dug into).
Due to 
[the relatively non-transparent Russian approval process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_V_COVID-19_vaccine#Scientific_assessment),
though, this does _not_ especially inspire confidence.  


### JnJ clinical trial population

This was not a small-time trial; JnJ really put some muscle behind it:  
- 44,325 volunteers total.   Half got the placebo and half got the treatment.  
- The trial was blinded until some number of COVID-19 cases were observed without knowing
  who was in which arm.  In this interim readout, unblinding revealed 468 symptomatic
  cases total in both arms.   
- They claimed efficacy in elderly, but as of yet have reported no hard data showing that.
  Press releases!  Feh.  
- Sites: 44% US, 41% Central/South America, and 15% South Africa.  
- Gender: 45% women, 55% men.  
- Race: 59% White, 45% Hispanic/LatinX, 13% Black, 6% Asian, 1% Native American.  

So that part looks pretty good!  Ok, not perfect.  But pretty good, for real-life trials.  


### JnJ vaccine interim efficacy results (not yet final)  

This is a single-dose vaccine (but [see below](#2-dose-follow-up-trial)!), so efficacy 
was measured 28 days after the first dose:  
- The US cohort had 72% efficacy.  Not as good as the 95% for Pfizer and Moderna, but
  still very good as these things go.  
- But&hellip; the Latin American cohort had an efficacy of 66%.  
- &hellip; and the South African cohort had an efficacy of only 57%.  

The differences in efficacy are worrisome.  Even more worrying, though typical of the scientific 
bungling in press releases, not enough information was disclosed to tell if the differences were
statistically significant.  However, they did report that in South Africa they believe
(but didn't specify if they had done the sequencing to tell) that the cases were 95%
driven by the B.1.351 variant.  That's the super-contagious variant in South Africa, worse
than the UK variant B.1.1.7.  So the South African efficacy decrease may be explained by
that; we just _can't tell from the reports of the oral press release_.  But&hellip; it
looks like it's not so good against the B.1.351 variant.  

Somewhat more hearteningly: overall the vaccine had 85% efficacy against _severe_ COVID-19,
and _100% efficacy against COVID-related hospitalizations._  This is _crucial:_ it shows the
JnJ vaccine, though not as good as the others, nonetheless is also effective at taking the
back-breaking load off hospitals.  

Also, 2 important metrics for comparison are well worth keeping in mind:
- The US FDA set a threshold of 50% efficacy for an approvable COVID-19 vaccine to stop
  community contagion, and this passes that threshold.  
- Flu vaccines, which we _know_ are a good thing in reducing both mortality and medical
  facility loading, are typically 40% &ndash; 60% effective (depending on the year and how many
  variants are circulating).  

So while we're all a bit dazzled by the 95% efficacy of Pfizer and Moderna, by these
objective standards the JnJ vaccine might be pretty good.  ("Might": once they stop
yakking at press releases and show actual hard data in the scientific literature or in
FDA submissions!)  


### JnJ cold chain requirements  

The really good news for the JnJ vaccine is the relaxed cold chain requirements.  Here are
the stability times at various temperatures for the 3 vaccines, as near as I can make out:  

<!-- How to get table borders in Kramdown? -->

|  __Vaccine__  | |  __-70&deg;C__   | |  __-20&deg;C__  | |  __2&deg;C &ndash; 8&deg;C__  | |  __Room temp__  |
|:-------------:|:-:|:------------:|:-:|:-----------:|:-:|:-------------------------:|:-:|:-----------:|
|  _Pfizer_     | |  1-6 months  | |      ?      | |     5 days                | |   ?         |
|  _Moderna_    | |       ?      | |  6 months   | |     1 month               | |  12 hr      |
|  _JnJ_        | |      ?       | |  2 years    | |     3 months              | |  ?          |


So JnJ is stable for longer times and at higher temperatures more accessible to smaller
institutions.  (Pfizer's stringent requirements limit it to big cities with large teaching
hospitals, research facilities, pharma laboratories, and universities.  Moderna, while
somewhat less demanding, is still pretty demanding of cold chain requirements.)  A relaxed cold
chain is especially important for shipping to more remote areas around the world, as well
as rural areas in the US, to help stamp out mutations.  


### JnJ 2-dose follow-up trial  

JnJ is also doing 2-dose trial, just like Pfizer and Moderna, to see if giving a second
dose boosts the efficacy, as it does for mRNA vaccines and many others.  This trial is 30k
pts, given 2 doses 57 days apart. The readout is expected summer or fall, depending on case rates.  

(The Weekend Editrix just got her first dose of 
[the shingles vaccine Shingrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoster_vaccine#Shingrix_2) 
yesterday, and consequently feels achy today, but looks forward to the second dose.
Two-dose vaccines are a fine thing, and work admirably when administered properly.)  

As Tony Fauci said to the NYT:  
> "If they get a prime boost, it’s entirely conceivable that they can get up to 90-plus
percent."  

That would be an _excellent_ outcome, to have a 3rd vaccine with &gt; 90% efficacy, even
if that required a second dose.  


### JnJ vaccine availability  

Only about 7mln doses are available quickly, and about 30mln by April, so it may not matter in a
practical sense.   Manufacturing has to gear up in Baltimore, later in 2021 (or very early
2022, at a guess?).  They've promised 100mln by end of June; I don't see how that can
happen, but then they know their capacity better than anybody else, so this gets a
tenative pass from me.  


## Politics  

Gratifyingly, the Republican clown car has not rolled up on this news and
disgorged&hellip; well&hellip; anything, really.  Perhaps 
[the adults really _are_ back in charge]({{ site.baseurl }}/adults-in-charge/)
again!  Or so one may hope.  


## Conclusion  

Overall, it's disappoinging that this vaccine is not at the 95% level we've seen before.
But, it's better than flu vaccines that we _already know_ are a good &amp; useful thing and it's
above the 50% efficacy threshold the FDA set to stop community spread.  

So&hellip; not a "knockout punch" in the words of Herper at STAT News, but still pretty
good and useful.
