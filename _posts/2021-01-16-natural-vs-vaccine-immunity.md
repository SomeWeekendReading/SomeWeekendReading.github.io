title: Is 'natural' immunity any better than vaccine immunity?

Periodically, anti-vaxxers will say they prefer the 'natural' immunity acquired by
recovering from a disease, because vaccines are 'artificial'.  Is that likely to be true
for COVID-19?  In a word: no.  


## 'Natural' immunity isn't as great as you think it is

The experience of having a disease is miserable, sometimes maiming or fatal.  For going
through that, you usually get immunity.  _Usually!_ Sometimes you get the reverse, called
_immune amnesia_.  Measles, for example, can reset your immune system so you _lose_
immumity for a couple years to everything _except_ the measles you just had.
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> That, combined with the miserably high infectivity of measles
($R_0 \sim 12 - 18$) <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, emphasizes
_how important it is to get MMR vaccinations for your kids._  Or yourself, for that
matter.  


## What's the efficacy of 'natural' immunity to COVID-19?  

Generally speaking, that's the way the trade-offs go: vaccines are almost always the
lower-risk way to go to get disease immunity.  What do we know about how this will shake
out for COVID-19?

Last week, a press release from _Public Health England_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>,
an agency of the UK government, gave us the answer.  This was confirmed by reporting from
the _British Medical Journal_, in a news report by Elisabeth Mahase 
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>.  

While they didn't disclose enough data to allow us to do an independent calculation for
peer review verification, the crucial result is:  

> Between 18 June and 24 November, scientists detected 44 potential reinfections (2
> 'probable' and 42 'possible' reinfections) out of 6,614 participants who had tested
> positive for antibodies. __This represents an 83% rate of protection from reinfection.__  

So, to summarize:  
- Going through the harrowing, life-threatening, hospital-breaking experience of COVID-19
  gets you immunity which has on average __83% efficacy.__  
- Getting a vaccination from the Moderna/Lonza or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will get you 
  __95% efficacy__, with only moderate aches &amp; pains and minimal burden on the 
  healthcare system.  

For the mathematically disinclined, we would like to point out that 95% > 83%.  

## The moral of this story  

When your turn comes up, _get vaccinated!_
