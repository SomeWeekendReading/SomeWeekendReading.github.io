Today I got shot (again).  In the good sense: the second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine.  


## The vaccine experience  

[Last time]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/) was a
[Kafkaesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka) nightmare, both for 
[getting the first dose appointment at all]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/#getting-an-appointment) 
and then 
[scheduling the second dose]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/#booking-the-2nd-appointment-for-the-booster).
This time, the appointment having been booked already, I just had to show up and do as I'm told.
("Showing up", I can manage.  "Doing as I'm told" has always been a lifelong struggle.
But if I have to struggle a bit to take on board another dose of 
BNT162/PF-07302048 <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, then "struggle" is the order of the day.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-24-today-i-got-shot-again-hypo.jpg" width="400" height="278" alt="Weekend Editor's portside dorsal manipulator tentacle being injected (again)" title="Weekend Editor's portside dorsal manipulator tentacle being injected (again)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Herein illustrated (again) is your humble Weekend Editor's portside dorsal manipulator
tentacle, again being injected with a lovely dose of BNT162/PF-07302048,
a.k.a. tozinameran/Comirnaty.  

Again, the actual vaccination process &ndash; separate from the sign-up nightmare &ndash;
went quite smoothly.  The Weekend Editrix dropped me at a train station, and I took a
couple of subway rides.  I was early, so I sat in the station happily reading 
[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) on my phone.  

At the appointed time, I took the short health quiz on my phone, went into the large
building, presented my id/appointment/health quiz/vax card and was waved into line.  A few seconds
later, the injection happened.  This time it was an older guy, a sort of gruff no-nonsense
fellow like a drill sergeant.  Friendly enough, though.  And he got the job done.  

The most oddbal thing was that somebody next to me fainted, apparently due to a fear of
needles.  Still, that person seemed to get very attentive care from the EMTs who were
standing by.  

Then a boring 15 minutes in the waiting area, to demonstrate that I was not in
anaphylactic shock, and I was done.  The best part: I didn't have to go back to the
absolutely miserable sign-up web site to book any more appointments!  A couple subway
rides later, and I was back in the custody of the Weekend Editrix.  

Maybe in the fall we'll all have to get a booster tuned to the VoCs (variants of
concern).  But until then, it's just waiting for antibody levels to build, and for memory
B-cells to form a grudge against the coronavirus spike protein.  

And _most importantly:_ back to the miserable sign-up web site, to find a slot for the
Weekend Editrix.  In spite of her youth, she has now just become eligible, so&hellip; "once
more into the breach", as I read in an old book somewhere or other.  


## The aftermath  

Tune in tomorrow, to see if there are more exciting sleepwalking adventures&hellip; which
I would gladly trade for a bit of aches &amp; fever instead.
