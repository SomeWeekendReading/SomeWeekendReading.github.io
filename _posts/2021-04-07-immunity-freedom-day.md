As of today, your humble Weekend Editor is 2 weeks past the 2nd dose of the Pfizer
vaccine.  At 5pm, I am officially out of COVID jail!  Right?  Not quite&hellip;


## What it means once you're fully vaccinated  

Recall that a vaccine efficacy of 95% means that I now have 5% of the probability/unit
time of getting COVID-19 as an unvaccinated person in similar exposure circumstances:

$$
\begin{align}\label{eq:efficacydefn}
\mbox{efficacy} = 100.0 * \(1 - \frac{\Pr(\mbox{infection} | \mbox{vax})}{\Pr(\mbox{infection} | \mbox{non-vax})}\)
\end{align}
$$

It means my risk is dramatically reduced (by 95%) compared to no vaccine at all, given
similar exposures.  It does not mean I'm bullet-proof.  In particular, it _does not mean_
that I can engage in COVID-risky behavior with wild abandon!  

Also, since the vaccine suppresses serious COVID (hospitaliztion/death), I could
nonetheless be an asymptomatic carrier and thus a danger to those around me who are as yet
unvaccinated.  Vaccines are about protecting yourself, and about not being a jerk to
everyone who comes near you, too.  

That will change once herd immunity is attained (assuming it _can_ be attained, 
[in spite of stubborn-stupid vaccine resistance]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021-03-10-republicans-vs-herd-immunity.md).  


## The real reason  

Of course, I have an ulterior motive.  No, nothing about being a scientist doing drug
research in the past; take your Big Pharma conspiracy theories elsewhere.  Trust me,
they're not _that_ smart.  

No, my real ulterior motive: the Weekend Editrix doesn't reach her Immunity Freedom Day
until May 5.  

After that, we can start looking at immunity numbers in the US (COVID convalescents +
vaccinees), and decide about the safety of a summer holiday.  Though, truth be told, I
really, _really_ miss [the Club Med in the Bahamas](https://www.clubmed.us/r/columbus-isle/y),
but that's not open until December 2021.  Anybody want to join us there in December or
January?
