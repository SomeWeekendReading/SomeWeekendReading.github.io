Apparently the Weekend Publisher, also sometimes known as "my cat", is the reincarnation
of the spirit animal of a fin-de-si&egrave;cle French cabaret.   

Who knew? <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>

I mean, I always _knew_ he was the reincarnation of of some ancient Egypitian cat-deity
like [Bastet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastet).  And of course, Bastet, being a deity
capable of frequent reincarnation, would definitely be catting around
fin-de-si&egrave;cle Paris, because _everybody_ wants to do that.  My cat's not
_stupid_&hellip;  

Though, now that I come to think of it, Bastet was a a cat _goddess_, which means my cat
is the _trans_ reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian cat deity.  Ok, nothing wrong with
that, right?  We need to accept trans people, and my cat thinks he's a person, so we're
all cool with that.  And, really: once you buy the "reincarnated ancient Egyptian cat
deity" business, you can't just decide to balk at the trans part, right?  Be cool.  

C'mon, don't embarass me here.  The cat is watching.  

The cat is _always_ watching.
