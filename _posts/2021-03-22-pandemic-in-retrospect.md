Time for perspective: we've been stuck in a pandemic for a year now.  What's the best
summary of your experience?  

## Light at the end of the tunnel?  

My anxious, pessimistic, depressive side continually reminds me that when you can see the light at
the end of the tunnel&hellip; you're _still in the tunnel._  That's what life has seemed
like to me, for most of the last year.  What's it been like for you?

The _Washington Post_ asked readers for their summaries. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
In my typically pessimistic view, the best description came from 9-year-old Clarke Smith,
who was also the favorite of the authors:  

> Like looking both ways before crossing the street and then getting hit by a submarine.  

Yep.  Kid knows what's goin' on.  

Of course, for visual thinkers, this police dashcam video is perhaps the best summary of
2020 and its sequelae.  (Go ahead and watch the short video.  Really.  I'll wait.)

["Fire bad.  Tree pretty."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=769qie9npes)  We should note
that, unlike COVID-19,  apparently nobody was hurt in that incident.  

Now, _that's_ a summary of my plague year: minding my own business, doing work in
cancer drug research, crawling toward retirment&hellip; and then _that_ happens.  

__Scary thought:__ Coulda been worse.  Think about _that_ for a second.  

Oy.
