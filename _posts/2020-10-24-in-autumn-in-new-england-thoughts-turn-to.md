At autumn in New England, thoughts turn to the extreme beauty of nature, the weather
turning more comfortably cooler &amp; drier, cinnamon and nutmeg smells everywhere,
and... trebuchets, catapaults, air cannons, and other implements of imparting to pumpkins
various levels of sub-orbital trajectories.  

It's autumn... _finally_.  2020, in a single year, has managed to impose several decades
of wear and tear on all of us.  But autumn _in New England_... well, even the most dour
and depressed heart such as that of your humble Weekend Editor cannot help but breath in
the beautiful scents and bask with relief in the beauty.  

## Autumnal stress-relief trip

This week, your Weekend Editor & Editrix went on a little trip to look at foliage in the 
[Berkshires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshires).  (Don't
judge us; it's a New England thing.)  We stayed at the (empty) house of some friends,
cooked for ourselves, work masks outside, and maintained extreme social distance.  But
was, quite literally, our first time away from home in the last 7 months due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.  So it was _special_.

The views from the hairpin turn near the Whitcomb Summit on the 
[Mohawk Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_Trail) in the 
Hoosac Range, and from the peak of
[Mt Greylock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Greylock) were spectacular!  (The 
[Bridge of Flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_Flowers_(bridge)) is also
pretty great, though perhaps this was not the correct time of the year.)  

At lower altitudes, Pontoosuc Lake and the view of the mountains from 
[The Clark](https://www.clarkart.edu/).  (The photo doesn't _quite_ capture how beautiful the
leaves falling at The Clark were; every gust of wind brought a huge hail of leaves down.
Your Weekend Editor is a crappy photographer.)  

Even something as simple as a backyard tree at the house of our friends, illuminated by a
sunset, was something to make one pause.  

So... yeah, that was pretty good.  

## The _other_ thing about autumn: pumpkins!

The other thing about autumn is what people get up to with pumpkins.  I mean, it' just
some innocent gourd, right?  But they decorate with them, even to 
[using glass labs at a major research university to craft blown-glass replicas](https://news.mit.edu/2020/its-virtual-great-glass-pumpkin-patch-mit-1021), 
a favorite of your Weekend Editrix.  And they carve them.  Good Heaven, they carve them in
oddball ways.  They even

from [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://drhorrible.com/).

But all this... _cute_ as it is... is as _nothing_ compared to what happens when mathematicians,
scientists, and engineers put their minds to The Problem of the Pumpkin.  For example, at
MIT (and apparently also at CalTech) there is a tradition of dropping pumpkins from high
buildings, to "investigate" the splatter patterns.  I once observed pumpkins filled with
liquid nitrogen, frozen solid, converting 22 stories of gravitational potential energy to
kinetic, interacting _most satisfactorily_ with the concrete & asphalt below.  (I swear
they flashed as they hit, maybe a [triboluminescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboluminescence)
thing going on there, like 
[the wintergreen Life-Savers example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboluminescence#Examples)?)  

Nonetheless... cute as _that_ is... it has recently come to my attention that there is a
higher form of pumpkin madness: the annual since 1986 
[World Championship Punkin Chunkin](https://www.punkinchunkin.com/).  They use trebuchets,
catapaults, and (my favorite) compressed air cannons apparently with multi-stage pressure
injection!

The record is a 2013 throw of a full-sized pumpkin for 4694.68ft.  (I love that they
hallucinate the ability to get a preicsion of 6 significant figures.)  Throwing a pumpkin
for just a bit short of a mile is... well, artillery.  It should come as no surprise that
it's being held at a small airport &mdash; they may need redirection of air traffic: if
you're going a mile downrange, you're probably going _up_ about half that &mdash; a flying
pumpkin at 2500 feet altitude is surely a hazard to air navigation.  

Their [rule book](https://www.punkinchunkin.com/the-competition/rules/) makes for for
interesting reading, too.  They've been at this for rather a long time (since 1986), and
have extensive (and laudable) safety rules.  Some are pretty obvious, like a strict no
alcohol policy and that minors must be always supervised.  

Still other rules make me scratch my head: "All pumpkins fired must remain intact until
they impact the ground to obtain an official measurement."  Now, _how can they tell_ if a
pumpkin disintegrates in flight?  A quick back of the envelope calculation says,
neglecting air resistance, to travel 4000 feet downrange launched at an optimal 45&deg;,
the muzzle velocity must be 243 mph &mdash; at which speed it's difficult to decide if the
pumpkin has cracked up enough.  

Some are... less obvious.  I
mean: if your hobby requires a Range Safety Officer, a no firearms policy, required
ultrasound testing of pressure vessels, and an explicit ban on explosives... it might be
time to rethink your life choices.__

Still, I bet it's a blast. There may be madness to their methods; but their madness is the 
[divine madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness).
