In autumn in New England, thoughts turn to the extreme beauty of nature, the weather
turning more comfortably cool, cinnamon and nutmeg smells everywhere, and... trebuchets,
catapaults, air cannons, and other implements of imparting to pumpkins various levels of
sub-orbital trajectories.  

It's autumn... _finally_.  2020, in a single year, has managed to impose several decades
of wear and tear on all of us.  But autumn _in New England_... well, even the most dour
and depressed heart such as that of your humble Weekend Editor cannot help but breath in
the beautiful scents and bask with relief in the beauty.  

## Autumnal stress-relief trip

This week, your Weekend Editor & Editrix went on a little trip to look at foliage in the 
[Berkshires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshires).  (Don't
judge us; it's a New England thing.)  We stayed at the (empty) house of some friends,
cooked for ourselves, work masks outside, and maintained extreme social distance.  But
was, quite literally, our first time away from home in the last 7 months due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.  So it was _special_.

The views from the hairpin turn near the Whitcomb Summit on the 
[Mohawk Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_Trail) in the 
Hoosac Range, and from the peak of
[Mt Greylock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Greylock) were spectacular!  (The 
[Bridge of Flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_Flowers_(bridge)) is also
pretty great, though perhaps this was not the correct time of the year.)  

At lower altitudes, Pontoosuc Lake and the view of the mountains from 
[The Clark](https://www.clarkart.edu/).  (The photo doesn't _quite_ capture how beautiful the
leaves falling at The Clark were; every gust of wind brought a huge hail of leaves down.
Your Weekend Editor is a crappy photographer.)  

Even something as simple as a backyard tree at the house of our friends, illuminated by a
sunset, was something to make one pause.  

So... yeah, that was pretty good.  

## The _other_ thing about autumn
