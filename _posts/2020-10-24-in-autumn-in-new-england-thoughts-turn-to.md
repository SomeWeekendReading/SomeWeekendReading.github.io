In autumn in New England, thoughts turn to the extreme beauty of nature, the weather
turning more comfortably cool, cinnamon and nutmeg smells everywhere, and... trebuchets,
catapaults, air cannons, and other implements of imparting to pumpkins various levels of
sub-orbital trajectories.  

It's autumn... _finally_.  2020, in a single year, has managed to impose several decades
of wear and tear on all of us.  But autumn _in New England_... well, even the most dour
and depressed heart such as that of your humble Weekend Editor cannot help but breath in
the beautiful scents and bask with relief in the beauty.  

This week, your Weekend Editor & Editrix went on a little trip to look at foliage.  We
stayed at the (empty) house of some friends, cooked for ourselves, and maintained extreme
social distance.  But was, quite literally, our first time away from home in the last 7
months.  So it was _special_.
