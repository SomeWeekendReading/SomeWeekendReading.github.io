[Randall Munroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe), the 
[mad](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/tags/#TheDivineMadness) cartoonist behind 
[XKCD](https://xkcd.com/), explains COVID-19 vaccine approvals.  And channels Lord Kelvin.
Simultaneously.  

## Data and its best summary ever  

The Kaplan-Meier curves for COVID-19 infections in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials
are, of course, beautiful:

[XKCD 2400](https://xkcd.com/2400/) has a quick summary of the situation, as always in
the simplest and clearest possible terms.  That's more or less what XKCD is _for_, right?
Absurdly clear explanations of phenomena absurdly trivial and absurdly important.
Sometimes simultaneously.

## Somebody already said that&hellip;

[As previously noted in this blog](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/Lord-Kelvin-on-quantitative-knowledge/), he is channeling Lord Kelvin:

>In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of __science__, whatever the matter may be.
