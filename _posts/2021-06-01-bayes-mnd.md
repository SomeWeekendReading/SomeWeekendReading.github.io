[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about the famous book, [_The Millionaire Next Door_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door).  It's good as far as it goes; it just doesn't go _nearly_ as far as almost everybody thinks!  


## The Millionaire Next Door  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-mnd-book.jpg" width="300" height="450" alt="Stanley &amp; Danko: The Millionaire Next Door" title="Stanley &amp; Danko: The Millionaire Next Door" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
In 1996, Stanley &amp; Danko published a now-famous book which was what amounts to a
sociological study of people in the US who were millionaires: 
[_The Millionaire Next Door_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
To say the least, it struck a nerve.  The empirical data did _not_ confirm the stereotypes
of expensive clothes, cars, and jewelry.  They did not live in large houses.  They were
not lavish spenders.  They quoted the astonished words of a bank VP of a trust department
<sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>:

> These people cannot be millionaires! They don't look like millionaires, they don't dress
> like millionaires, they don't eat like millionaires, they don't act like
> millionaires &mdash; they don't even have millionaire names. Where are the millionaires who
> look like millionaires?  

(Keep in mind this book was published 25 years ago.  A million dollars in the US was
_real_ money back then!  According to the 
[Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI inflation calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm),
that's about \$1.7 million in mid-2021.)  

The main results of Stanley & Danko are:  
- _Millionaires don't buy status junk._ They tend to look pretty ordinary.  They are not
  flashy at all.  People who look flashy are cosplayers attempting to _look_ rich.  As an
  example, Stanley & Danko described their bank trust officer above as wearing a fancy
  suit, a \$5000 watch, and driving a current-model luxury imported car.  He was attempting
  to look rich, to win the trust of rich customers.  He was not, himself, rich.  (NB:
  _billionaires_, on the other hand, are a different sort of duck.)  
- _Millionaires spend less than they earn, and invest the difference._  They don't spend
  tomorrow's money today, but have budgets.  
- _Millionaires take financial risk only when it's worth it._  They don't buy lottery
  tickets, speculate in insanely risky investments like commodities/options/penny stocks,
  and they are adequately insured (health, life, liability, etc.).  
- _Millionaires educate their kids in financial literacy, and get them into
  self-sustaining careers._  Their kids are not continually needing parental support
  because they got good educations that led to useful, satisfying careers where they can
  support themselves (e.g., STEM degrees and professions).  Or they started small
  businesses that had a shot at success.  

They derived a jargony formula, for determining "average accumulators of wealth (AAW)" and
"prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAW)".  Basically, for an AAW your age times your
income, divided by 10, should be about your net worth excluding inheritances.  A PAW
should do about twice that.  Here are some [R](https://www.r-project.org) functions to
help you explore that:  
```R
    mndAAW <- function(age, inc) { 0.1 * age * inc      }
    mndPAW <- function(age, inc) { 2 * mndAAW(age, inc) }
```

I once realized these could be worked backwards: given your age and net worth, what income
would a PAW need to achieve that?  If your income is lower, congratulations: you're
accumulating net worth even faster than a PAW.  If your income is higher, figure out where
you can spend more efficiently &amp; save more.  
```R
    pawInc <- function(age, nw)  { 5 * nw / age         }
```

## What's wrong with that?  

So that's fine&hellip; I guess.  It's nice to know that the people in the upper middle
class and the lower end of the upper class seem much more down to earth than the
sociopathic billionaires.  (I just made an interesting typo: "villionaires", perhaps a
portmanteau of "villain" and "billionaire"?  Hmm.)  

What got people's engines revving, particularly those of the more feverish conservative or
libertarian sort, was that apparently 2/3 of the millionaires interviewed were owners of
small businesses.  "Aha!  That's for me," they thought, "I'll start a business and get
rich!"  They always think business owners are the savoirs of society, and seized upon this
as though it were empirical evidence.  

That's just&hellip; _wrong_.  

First, the book is an empirical survey of people who are already millionaires.  It is
_not_ a survey of the sorts of people who become millionaires and the ways they do that.
It does not talk about all the people who resemble the interviewed millionaires but failed
to become rich through luck, timing, geography, or anything else.  

Second, the misunderstanding betrays a fundamental ignorance of statistics.  Stanley &amp;
Danko asked: if we sample millionaires, what sort of people are they?  The fever dream
people were doing the reverse: if we sample people of a certain sort, are they likely to
be or become millionaires?  

So there's _nothing at all wrong_ with Stanley &amp; Danko's book: it's fine, as far as it
goes.  It just doesn't go where most people _think_ it goes!  


## Letting some air out of the balloon with Bayes Rule  

We can show this, with some slight degree of melodrama, using
[Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).  

Stanley &amp; Danko's research demonstrates that if you sample millionaires, you're likely
to find that about 2/3 of them own a business:

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) = 2/3
$$

But the question to which most readers wanted the answer was not about the characteristics
of those already rich.  Rather, they want to know what to do to become rich themselves.
They want to know what's the probability of achieving financial security, if they start a
business:  

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) = \mathrm{?}
$$

The truth is, most businesses flame out early.  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics says
most businesses flame out within about 4 years. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>

Can we estimate $\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business})$ from 
$\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich})$ and some ancillary data?  Yes, that's what Bayes'
Rule does for us:  

$$
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) &= \frac{\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{rich})}{\Pr(\mathrm(business))} \\
                                         &= \frac{\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{rich})}{\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{rich}) + \Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{not.rich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{not.rich})}
\end{align*}
$$

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-mnd-bls-self-employment.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="BLS: US self-employment (excluding agriculture) vs time" title="BLS: US self-employment (excluding agriculture) vs time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
So we need to know $\Pr(\mathrm{rich})$ (the probability somebody is rich), and 
$\Pr(\mathrm{business})$ (the probability they own a business):  
- For being "rich", let's target the top 1% of US wealth, which is about a net worth of
  \$4.4 million. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  Unsurprisingly, the probability of being
  in the top 1% is&hellip; 1%.  
- A BLS statistic <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> tells us that about the self-employed
  component of the US has been declining over time, but is about 7.5% today. (Outside
  agriculture; agriculture is a whole different beast, but it is a terribly small part of
  the work force today.)  We'll use "self-employed" as a probable _overestimate_ of the
  business-owners.  We'll also use this as a proxy for the "not rich" business owners,
  since we assume becoming rich is relatively rare.  
  
So here's what we know:  

$$
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich})     &= 0.67  \\
  \Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{not.rich}) &= 0.075 \\
  \Pr(\mathrm{rich})                         &= 0.01  \\
  \Pr(\mathrm{not.rich})                     &= 0.99
\end{align*}
$$

Plug that into Bayes' Rule above:  

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) = \frac{0.67 * 0.01}{0.67 * 0.01 + 0.075 * 0.99} = 8.3\%
$$

So basically, if you think owning a business is the road to riches, you're satisfied with
only an 8.3% chance of success!  Ok, sure, that's more than the 1% chance you'd have if
you started at random, but 8.3% is by no means certain.  All it says is that the business
class is "enriched for richness", not that starting a business will make you rich.  


## A modest counterpoint  

Perhaps someone will point out, as someone always does, that the top 1% of the US is a
bunch of evil super-billionaires.  I mean, that's factually false, since the data above
says the entry threshold is \$4.4 million, not \$1 billion.  But let's indulge this
theoretical critic, since critics are the most valuable friend an idea can have.  

Instead, let's just say the target for "rich" is being in the financial top 10% of the
US.  Surely that's pretty comfortable?  Wouldn't we like to know if starting a business
could at least raise the chance we could be comfortable?  

Let's see if that's a possibility:  

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) = \frac{0.67 * 0.10}{0.67 * 0.10 + 0.075 * 0.90} = 50\%
$$

Now _there's_ something to talk about: you get a 50% shot at being in the top decile of
wealth.  You've _quintupled_ your chances.  

Of course, there are other ways: get a good university degree, perhaps in a STEM field;
perhaps get an advanced degree; work in an industry that does some good in the world; live
below your means and invest the difference.  At retirement age, you'll be comfortable.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

We've examined some popular sentiment about Stanley &amp; Danko's _The Millionaire Next
Door_.  As an exploratory study in the sociology of wealth in the US 25 years ago, there's
nothing at all wrong with it.  Good work.  

It does _not_, however, imply what many people think: owning a business is not a road to
riches.  The path to success there is only about 8.3%, after a Bayesian analysis.
However, doing _anything_ productive with your life, sustained over time, with reasonable
spending budgets and intelligent investing&hellip; will likely have a good outcome.

There's no magic here: you don't _have_ to be a business owner.  You _do_ have to be
productive, patient, and reasonably able to budget.
