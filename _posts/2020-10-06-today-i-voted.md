Today I voted.  You should too, if you're an eligible US voter.  

The anxiously-awaited mail-in ballot arrived via US Mail at 9:30am.  By 11:30am, it was
filled out, put in the ballot envelope, signed exactly as requested, put in the mailer
envelope, then walked _past the Post Office_<sup id="fn1a">[[1](#fn1)]</sup> to the town
clerk's drop-box, and therein deposited.  

Please don't vote Republican.  Not for any imaginable office, not under any conceivable
circumstance.  Please don't vote 3rd party: that's half a vote for Trump.  If you think he
needs to go &mdash; and _you should_ &mdash; then you know you have to vote for
Biden/Harris.  Just do it: [settle for Biden](https://www.settleforbiden.org/).  

## Notes  

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Too much Republican mischief at the Post Office: [72% of the mail sorting machines removed "for cost savings" were in counties won by Clinton in the last election](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/postmaster-dejoy-sorting-machines-stripped-for-parts_n_5f6d71d5c5b64deddeeb9107), according to a federal court finding.  So... it's _deliberate_.[â†©](#fn1a)
