Hank Green once again has one or two true and useful words for young people about COVID-19
vaccination.  


## Dude knows what he's talking about

[Previously, we featured]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccine-sense-from-hank-green) a sensible
word or two from [Hank Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Green) (notable web
producer, author, and master of miscellany) in his weekly vlog to his brother.  Bizarrely,
Google says that's the most frequent search hit of all the pages on this blog.  People are&hellip;
a bit weird.  

Now vaccines are available fairly widely for free (at least in the US), and even to people
as young as 12.  So Hank has a thing to two to say to young people specifically.  And take
it from a grumpy old scientist: he _still_ knows what he's talking about.  

Some of his points:  
- The graph of vaccinations vs time is flattening out, when it should go up to 100% as
  fast as possible.  This is a problem: a public health problem, i.e., for all of us, not
  just individual choices.  
- Excuses and responses to vaccination delay:  
  - "It's slightly unpleasant, and I'll feel crappy."  __Response:__ COVID-19 is way crappier,
    especially if you give it to somebody else inadvertently, who may die from it.
    Vaccination lowers the risk of that by 95%.  
  - "What about variants?"  __Response:__ Every COVID-19 variant evolved in an infected
    person.  Don't be that person.  Get vaccinated.  
  - "Maybe I already had COVID-19."  __Response:__ ['Natural' immunity is inferior]({{ site.baseurl }}/natural-vs-vaccine-immunity/) to the very high immunity from the vaccines.  
  - "I feel like I'm giving up control."  __Response:__ getting vaccinated is you _taking back_
    control!  

A heartfelt plea:
