Today we commemorate 1983-Sep-26: the day Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov prevented the end the
world.  Go thou forth and do likewise: _save as much of the world as you can_.

Ozy [once wrote at _Thing of Things_](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/09/26/stanislav-petrov-day/) 
inviting us to imagine a club in Heaven, called something like the _Billionaire's Club_.
Not, of course, rich guys, because... eugh.  Rather, a club of people who have saved a
billion human lives.  Can there be such a thing?  Who might be in such a club?  

Depending on your religious community, you might of course imagine your deity as club
president (creating/redeeming humanity hath its perks).  But who else?  Ozy starts us off
with 9 names:  

* [Vasili Arkhipov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov): flotilla commander of
a group of Soviet submarines during the Cuban missile crisis, he _overruled_ the submarine
captains and forbade them to launch nuclear torpedoes.  (See bottom left of image above.)

* [Stanislav Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov): duty officer in a
Soviet nuclear early warning system, he _disobeyed procedure_ and refused to forward an
alarm up the chain of command, stopping a nuclear launch on a false alarm.  (See image
above.)  

* [Karl Landsteiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Landsteiner): discovered how to
measure blood types, making transfusions (and surgery generally) less lethal.  

* [Fritz Haber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Haber)<sup id="fn1a">[[1](#fn1)]</sup> &amp; 
[Carl Bosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bosch), who invented a chemical process
for nitrogen fixation making most of the world's fertilizer.  Most of the nitrogen atoms
in your body come from food produced by their reactions.  

* [Adolph Hustin, Luis Agote, and Richard Lewisohn](https://stanfordbloodcenter.org/a-brief-history-of-blood-transfusion-through-the-years/), 
before whom we couldn't really reliably store blood for transfusion.  

* [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug)<sup id="fn2a">[[2](#fn2)]</sup>, 
father of the "Green Revolution", new species of cereal grains which now feed most of humanity.  

Today is the anniversary of Petrov's decision not to follow orders that would almost
certainly led to the extinction of humanity.  I first learned about the details of his
story from 
[a very short essay by Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QtyKq4BDyuJ3tysoK/9-26-is-petrov-day).
Sunlight reflected off clouds had convinced a Soviet satellite watching a US missle base
that 5 missiles had launched.  Petrov, on his own authority, defied the launch on warning
standing orders and declared it a false alarm.  Probably Petrov thought something like, "One
missile, I can understand &mdash; that's an accident.  One thousand missiles, I can understand
&mdash; that's an attack.  But FIVE missiles?  This I cannot understand."  Or as Eliezer
put it:  

> Petrov decided that, all else being equal, he would prefer not to destroy the world.

Today in the "rationalist community"<sup id="fn3a">[[3](#fn3)]</sup> surrounding
Yudkowsky, people have invented rituals with which to celebrate Petrov Day (e.g., 
[here](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2020/07/03/petrov-day/),
[here (coronavirus edition)](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2020/09/18/petrov-day-ritual-coronavirus-edition/), 
[here](http://petrovday.com/)).  It's a thing
well worth celebrating, the survival of humanity, no?  

So take a minute today to celebrate Petrov Day properly: do something that doesn't end the
world, but saves/improves/redeems everything within your reach.  Being a member of
the Billionaire's Club isn't the point; doing everything within your reach _is_.  

> Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief.  Do justly, now.  Love mercy,
> now.  Walk humbly, now.  You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you
> free to abandon it. &mdash; Rabbi Tarfon, _Pirke Avot_ 2:21, _Talmud_

__Notes:__ 

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Haber is a _provisional_ member of the club, as he is also to some
extent the father of modern chemical warfare.  Opinion on his membership status is
divided. [↩](#fn1a)  

<a id="fn2">2</a>: Though, admittedly, at huge costs in fossil-fuel-derived fertilizers.
Probably a net win overall, but climate change may change our opinions, as well. [↩](#fn2a)  

<a id="fn3">3</a>: An eccentric but fascinating community of people attempting to become
more rational, more deliberate, more responsive to evidence, and able to live better
lives.  Like all such attempts, they have their good days and bad days.  See, e.g., the
[_Less Wrong_ blog community](https://www.lesswrong.com/). [↩](#fn3a)
