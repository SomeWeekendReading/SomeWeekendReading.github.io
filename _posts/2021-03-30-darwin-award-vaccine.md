Sometimes politicians pursue policies so _breathtakingly_ out of touch with reality, you
just don't know what to say.  Understandable, because "breathtaking".  


## The Darwin Prize  

Back in the 1980s, a group of wags proposed something they called the 
["Darwin Awards"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Awards) to be given to those who
perform some action so breathtakingly stupid that they either get themselves accidentally
killed or sterilized, thereby marginally improving the human gene pool.  

As it says [on this blog's quotes page]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/):  
> "Creatures inveterately wrong in their inductions have a pathetic but praiseworthy
> tendency to die before reproducing their kind." &mdash; W V O Quine, "Natural Kinds", 
> in _Ontological Relativity and Other Essays_, 1969.  

That dubious, though funny, [tradition continues to this day](https://darwinawards.com/).  

__Let it be noted clearly:__ by calling out someone's behavior as worthy of a Darwin Award, we are not
in any way wishing them harm, let alone death.  But we _are_ calling out the
skull-breaking stupidity of their alleged deeds.  


## And the nomination goes to&hellip;

&hellip;the First Minister of Wales,
[Mark Drakeford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Drakeford).  

At first glance, beyond his succeeding to the position of First Minister, he seems an
otherwise unremarkable Labour politician.  Maybe even a decent fellow, who has 
[remained married to the same woman for 40+ years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Drakeford#First_Minister).
Ok, he apparently rather impractically studied Latin at university, which makes him
interesting only because your humble Weekend Editor is also a bit of a Latin nerd.
(Though I was smart enough to confine it to high school.)  

He was in charge of COVID-19 strategy, including vaccination, in Wales, which brings his
policy reasoning to our attention.
[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Drakeford#First_Minister) his
leadership meant the rules were better undersood in Wales than Boris Johnson could do in
England.  Bit of a low bar, perhaps, but at least he was on the right side of it.  

_I want to like this guy._  


## So why a Darwin for him?  

The highest priority for public health, once vaccines became available, was getting it
into arms _as fast as possible._  I haven't decided what to think about reserving 2nd
doses vs using them as 1st doses for more people, but the case for getting 1st doses out
as fast as possible is beyond dispute.  Anything else spreads the disease, costs lives,
and encourages more lethal variants to crop up.  

Drakeford's brilliant strategy, according to _The Guardian_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, was
to _slow down_ the use of initially limited supplies of the Pfizer vaccine, to "make it
last" until the next delivery:  

> We will be using all the Oxford vaccine that we get as we get it, __the Pfizer vaccine has
> to last us__ until into the first week of February.  
>  
> So we have to provide it on a week-by-week basis. What you can’t do is to try and stand
> up a system which uses all the vaccine you’ve got in week one and then have nothing to
> offer for the next four weeks.  
>  
> We won’t get another delivery of the Pfizer vaccine until the very end of January or
> maybe the beginning of February, so that 250,000 doses has got to last us six weeks.  
>  
> That’s why you haven’t seen it all used in week one, because we’ve got to space it out
> over the weeks that it’s got to cover.

So there are 2 strategies under consideration here:  
1. Vaccinate as many people _now_, as fast as possible.  Then wait for the next delivery
   and do it again.  
2. Slow down vaccinations so you're vaccinating every day at a constant rate, and run out
   of vaccine just in time for the next delivery.  This was Drakeford's policy.  

Strategy (1) vaccinates a bunch of people as fast as possible, making them at least
partially immune.  Strategy (2) makes those same people wait, while you vaccinate slowly
for no particular reason other than that you want to be seen _doing_ something every day.
It sacrifices lives for political theatre.  

Vaccines are not like food, to be rationed out in an emergency over a period of time, to
prevent starvation.  The correct strategy is to _use them up_ by getting them into
people's arms as fast as possible.  The alternative is to make people wait, during which
time some of them will die.  

Technically, a Darwin Awardee must be killed by their own deed, or at least accidentally
sterilized so they do not reproduce further.  Drakeford does not therefore qualify.
But&hellip; given that some probably substantial number of people died before this policy
was corrected, he's certainly had an effect on others.
