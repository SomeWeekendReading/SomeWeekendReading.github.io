__DRAFT__ You all are scaring me, with your science denying, mask refusing, socially close quarters,
holiday travelling ways.  C'mon: wear a mask, socially distance, avoid indoor gatherings,
get a flu shot.  At least _pretend to try_ you want to live until the vaccine is
available, ok?  Then maybe you won't randomly kill the rest of us, who _do_ want to live.  

People are behaving stupidly <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>: not wearing masks (or
wearing them maliciously, e.g., _under_ their noses), traveling for holidays, going to parties,
not getting flu shots, agitating _against_ vaccines for _anything_&hellip; And that
doesn't even begin to cover it &ndash; I can barely believe the sack-of-hammers crazy
stuff I've heard people say in all somber seriousness.  


## Death rates

It's all starting to terrify me, because this level of stupidity is often a capital crime
in the court that enforces the laws of nature.  A
[_Journal of the American Medical Association_](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama)
editorial by 3 public health experts <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> notes that COVID-19
is now the _leading cause of death in the US_!  Worse than cancer.  Worse than heart
disease.  It's been an age since that was true of an infectious disease.  They note the
current US death rate is equivalent to 15 plane crashes a day, each killing 150
passengers.  It's like having a 9/11 event every day and a half.  It could even be up to
about 50% worse due to reporting delays, coding mistakes, and general pandemic overload in
the healthcare system.  Their conclusion:  
> The need for the entire population to take the disease seriously—notably to wear masks and maintain social distance—could not be more urgent.  


## Case rates  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-NYT-US-cases-vs-time.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="CDC: US COVID-19 cases vs time" title="CDC: US COVID-19 cases vs time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-CDC-US-cases-vs-time.jpg" width="400" height="290" alt="NYT: US COVID-19 cases vs time" title="NYT: US COVID-19 cases vs time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Some graphics from the _New York Times_ and the CDC agree: the third wave in the US is
viscious.  It was frightening in the spring.  It was annoying in the summer (though in New
England we seem to have skipped that one, thankfully).  It's _infuriating_ now: how can
people not have been paying attention?!  

Note the structure in that 3rd peak: see the bump up in case rates in December?  That's
the beginning of the payment in misery and lives for reckless Thanksgiving gatherings.  

<!-- Cases per 100,000 show localized hotspots at the county level -->
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-NYT-US-cases-per-capita-by-county.jpg" width="400" height="307" alt="NYT: US COVID-19 cases per 100,000 by county" title="NYT: US COVID-19 cases per 100,000 by county" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
When you break it down geographically, this county-by-county map from the _NYT_ shows that
there are definite hot spots.  

You can slice &amp; dice these data in a number of ways, but right now I'm glad that here
at Chez Weekend we're comparatively safe in New England.  I say _comparatively_ because of
course we are not safe: there's plenty of COVID-19 here. Just not the nightmare of the
South, or southern California.  

So all the numbers in that _JAMA_ editorial are even more damning.  We don't just have a
high death rate, we have geographically concentrated high death rates.  Why then, are all
the red states not yelling for help because our government is hanging them out to dry with
little to no public health support?  I really don't get it.  Were I prone to conspiracy
theories, I'd tend to theorize that somebody is trying to lower the population in the
conservative states, and has somehow gotten them to buy into their own deaths.  _It makes
no sense._

A century ago, our elders knew how to do it right.  Why don't we?
