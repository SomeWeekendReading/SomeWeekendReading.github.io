treasonable to the American public."

"Those who profess to favor freedom, yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops
without plowing up the ground.  They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the
ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.  This struggle may be a moral one; or it
may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a
struggle.  Power concedes nothing without a demand.  It never did and it never will."
&mdash; [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass),

["Logic of Empire" (1941)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_Empire))  

"What is true is already so.  
Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.  
Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.  
And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.  
Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived.  
People can stand what is true,  
for they are already enduring it." &mdash; [Eugene Gendlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin)  

"Any sufficiently advanced JK Rowling is indistinguishable from magic." &mdash; [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky), [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality)  

"&hellip; if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a fact about your own state of mind, not
a fact about the phenomenon itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact
about whatever you were uncertain about; that ignorance existed in the mind, not in
reality; that a blank map did not correspond to a blank territory. There were mysterious
questions, but a mysterious answer was a contradiction in terms." 
&mdash; [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky), channelling 
ET Jaynes in 
[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality)

quoted in A. L. Mackay, _The Harvest of a Quiet Eye_, 1977.  

"Not only is the universe stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine."

"We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question that divides us is whether it is
crazy enough to have a chance of being correct." &mdash; Niels Bohr, on evaluating a
colleague's work  

"Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper." 
&mdash; [Robert Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost)

His purpose." &mdash; [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale) (1820-1910)

[Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson and Nobel Laureate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford)  

"Statistical and applied probabilistic knowledge is the core of knowledge; statistics is
what tells you if something is true, false, or merely anecdotal; it is the 'logic of
science'; it is the instrument of risk-taking; it is the applied tools of epistemology;
you can't be a modern intellectual and not think probabilistically &mdash; but... let's not be
suckers. The problem is much more complicated than it seems to the casual, mechanistic
user who picked it up in graduate school. Statistics can fool you." 
&mdash; [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb), 
[The Fourth Quadrant: a Map of the Limits of Statistics](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/taleb08/taleb08_index.html)

(But see: "It is easier to lie without them." &amp; [Frederick Mosteller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Mosteller), founding chair of the Harvard statistics department.)  

"Most people use statistics the way a drunk uses a lamp post -- more for support than
enlightenment." &mdash; [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain)  

"A big computer, a complex algorithm and a long time does not equal science." 
&mdash; [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician)), 
one of the invetors of [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), 
at SSC 2003, Halifax (June 2003).  


## The Religious  

"Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime; therefore, we are saved by hope. 
Nothing true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; 
therefore, we are saved by faith.  Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished
alone; therefore, we are saved by love." 
&mdash; [Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr)  

"Niebuhr was a critic of national innocence, which he regarded as a
delusion. &hellip; &lsquo;Nations, as individuals, who are completely innocent in
their own esteem,&rsquo; Niebuhr wrote, &lsquo;are insufferable in their human
contacts.&rsquo; The self-righteous delusion of innocence encouraged a kind of
Manichaeism dividing the world between good (us) and evil (our critics)."
&mdash; [Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_M._Schlesinger,_Jr.), in 
["Forgetting Reinhold Niebuhr"](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/books/review/forgetting-reinhold-niebuhr.html), 
a NYT essay on why American conservative religious hysteria ignores 
[Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr),
perhaps one of the 20th century's greatest theologians  

"Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary." &mdash; [Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr)  

"We could bring calamity on ourselves and the world by forgetting that even the most powerful nations &hellip; remain themselves creatures as well as creators of the historical process." &mdash; [Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr), _The Irony of American History_(1952)  

"It's not necessary to be a saint to do good.  You need willing hands, not clean ones."
&mdash; [Mother Theresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa)  

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." &mdash; Phillip K
Dick  

"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food,
they call me a communist." &mdash; Dom Helder Camara, archbishop of Recife and apostle of social
justice  

"Truth, like gold, is to be obtained not by its growth, but by washing away from it all
that is not gold." &mdash; Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoy  

"Believe nothing, no matter where you read it or who has said it, not even if I have said
it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense." &mdash; Buddha  

"Once for all, then, a short precept is given you: Love, and do what you will:
whether you hold your peace, through love hold your peace; whether you cry out,
through love cry out; whether you correct, through love correct; whether you spare,
through love do you spare: let the root of love be within, of this root can nothing
spring but what is good. &mdash; 
[St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo),
[Homily 7 on 1 John](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170207.htm)  

"Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other
parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the stars and even their sizes and
distances,&hellip;  and this knowledge he holds with certainty from reason and
experience. It is thus offensive and disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian
talk nonsense about such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in
Scripture. We should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, lest
the unbeliever see only ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn."
&mdash; [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo), 
_De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim_ (_The Literal Meaning of Genesis_)  

"It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers.  That is
false: tragically false.  Look for yourself.  This is the concentration camp and
crematorium at Auschwitz.  This is where people were turned into numbers.  Into this
pond were flushed the ashes of four million people.  And that was not done by gas.  It
was done by arrogance.  It was done by dogma.  It was done by ignorance.  When people
believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality &mdash; this is how
they behave.  This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods&hellip;
In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of
Christ: Think it possible you may be mistaken.'" &mdash; Jacob Bronowski, _The Ascent of
Man_  

"They lied to you. The Devil is not the Prince of Matter; the Devil is the arrogance of
the spirit, faith without smile, truth that is never seized by doubt. The Devil is grim
because he knows where he is going, and, in moving, he always returns whence he came."
&mdash; [Umberto Eco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco), _The Name of the Rose_  

"Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire."
&mdash; [Gustav Mahler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler)  

"Adam was but human &mdash; this explains it all. He did not want the apple for the apple's
sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the
serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent." 
&mdash; [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_twain)  

"Faith is something more to be struggled with than had." &mdash; Jeremy Ahouse  

"Doubt isn't the opposite of faith; it is an element of faith."
&mdash; [Paul Tillich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich)  

"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense,
reason, and intellect has intended us to forego their use."
&mdash; [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei)  

"&hellip; some are guilty, but all are responsible." 
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)  

"When I was young, I used to admire intelligent people; as I grow older, I admire
kind people." 
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)
