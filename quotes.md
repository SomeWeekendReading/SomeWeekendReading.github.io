a fact about the phenomenon itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact

reality; that a blank map did not correspond to a blank territory. There were mysterious
questions, but a mysterious answer was a contradiction in terms."

[Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, and Nobel Laureate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford)  

"Statistical and applied probabilistic knowledge is the core of knowledge; statistics is
what tells you if something is true, false, or merely anecdotal; it is the 'logic of
science'; it is the instrument of risk-taking; it is the applied tools of epistemology;
you can't be a modern intellectual and not think probabilistically &mdash; but... let's not be
suckers. The problem is much more complicated than it seems to the casual, mechanistic
user who picked it up in graduate school. Statistics can fool you." 
&mdash; [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb),

## The Religious Ones  

"Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime;<br> 
therefore, we are saved by hope.<br>
Nothing true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history;<br>
therefore, we are saved by faith.<br>
Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone;<br>
therefore, we are saved by love."
&mdash; [Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr)  

"Niebuhr was a critic of national innocence, which he regarded as a
delusion. &hellip; &lsquo;Nations, as individuals, who are completely innocent in
their own esteem,&rsquo; Niebuhr wrote, &lsquo;are insufferable in their human
contacts.&rsquo; The self-righteous delusion of innocence encouraged a kind of
Manichaeism dividing the world between good (us) and evil (our critics)."
&mdash; [Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_M._Schlesinger,_Jr.), in 
["Forgetting Reinhold Niebuhr"](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/books/review/forgetting-reinhold-niebuhr.html),

[Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr),

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." &mdash; Phillip K
Dick  

"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food,
they call me a communist." &mdash; Dom Helder Camara, archbishop of Recife and apostle of social
justice

it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense." &mdash; Buddha  

"Once for all, then, a short precept is given you: Love, and do what you will:
whether you hold your peace, through love hold your peace; whether you cry out,
through love cry out; whether you correct, through love correct; whether you spare,
through love do you spare: let the root of love be within, of this root can nothing
spring but what is good. &mdash; 
[St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo),
[Homily 7 on 1 John](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170207.htm)  

"Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other
parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the stars and even their sizes and
distances,&hellip;  and this knowledge he holds with certainty from reason and
experience. It is thus offensive and disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian
talk nonsense about such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in
Scripture. We should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, lest
the unbeliever see only ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn."
&mdash; [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo), 
_De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim_ (_The Literal Meaning of Genesis_)  

"It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers.  That is
false: tragically false.  Look for yourself.  This is the concentration camp and
crematorium at Auschwitz.  This is where people were turned into numbers.  Into this
pond were flushed the ashes of four million people.  And that was not done by gas.  It
was done by arrogance.  It was done by dogma.  It was done by ignorance.  When people
believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality &mdash; this is how
they behave.  This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods&hellip;
In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of
Christ: Think it possible you may be mistaken.'" &mdash; Jacob Bronowski, _The Ascent of
Man_  

"They lied to you. The Devil is not the Prince of Matter; the Devil is the arrogance of
the spirit, faith without smile, truth that is never seized by doubt. The Devil is grim
because he knows where he is going, and, in moving, he always returns whence he came."
&mdash; [Umberto Eco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco), _The Name of the Rose_  

"Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire."
&mdash; [Gustav Mahler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler)  

"Adam was but human &mdash; this explains it all. He did not want the apple for the apple's
sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the
serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent." 
&mdash; [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_twain)  

"Faith is something more to be struggled with than had." &mdash; Jeremy Ahouse  

"Doubt isn't the opposite of faith; it is an element of faith."
&mdash; [Paul Tillich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich)  

"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense,
reason, and intellect has intended us to forego their use."
&mdash; [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei)  

"The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult
and left untried."

"...there is a law written in the darkest of the Books of Life, and it is this: If you look
at a thing nine hundred and ninety-nine times, you are perfectly safe; if you look at it
the thousandth time, you are[Pg 24] in frightful danger of seeing it for the first
time."
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton),
_The Napoleon of Notting Hill_, p. 23-24.  

"All science, even the divine science, is a sublime detective story. Only it is not set to detect why a man is dead; but the darker secret of why he is alive."
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton),
[_The Thing_ Ch 9 'What do they think?'](http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/The_Thing.txt).  

"I have sometimes had occasion to murmur meekly that those who endure the heavy labour
of reading a book might possibly endure that of reading the title-page of a book.  For
there are more examples than may be imagined, in which earnest critics might solve many of
their problems about what a book is, merely by discovering what it professes to be." 
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton),
on critics who misunderstood 
[_The Man Who Was Thursday_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Was_Thursday).  

"The voice of the special rebels and prophets, recommending discontent, should ... sound
now and then suddenly, like a trumpet. But the voices of the saints and sages,
recommending contentment, should sound unceasingly, like the sea."
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton)  

"The Bible tells us to love our neighbors, and also to love our enemies; probably because
generally they are the same people."
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton)  

"Religious liberty might be supposed to mean that everybody is free to discuss
religion. In practice it means that hardly anybody is allowed to mention it."
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton),
_Autobiography_, 1937.  

"To have a right to do a thing is not at all the same as to be right in doing it." 
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton), _A Short
History of England_, chapter 10.

"I believe what really happens in history is this: the old man is always wrong; and the
young people are always wrong about what is wrong with him. The practical form it takes is
this: that, while the old man may stand by some stupid custom, the young man always
attacks it with some theory that turns out to be equally stupid."
&mdash; [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton)  

"Above all, the prophets remind us of the moral state of a people: __Few are guilty, but all
are responsible.__ If we admit that the individual is in some measure conditioned or
affected by the spirit of society, an individual’s crime discloses society’s
corruption. In a community not indifferent to suffering, uncompromisingly impatient with
cruelty and falsehood, continually concerned for God and every \[person\], crime would be
infrequent rather than common."
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel), _The Prophets_.  

"When I was young, I used to admire intelligent people; as I grow older, I admire
kind people." 
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)  

"A prophet is ... a witness to the divine pathos, one who bears testimony to God's concern
for human beings."
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)  

"The opposite of good is not evil, but indifference."
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)  

"... to speak about God and remain silent on Vietnam is blasphemous."
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)  

"We want experiences, fitting ones, of profound connection with others, of deep
understanding of natural phenomena, of love, of being profoundly moved by music or
tragedy, or doing something new and innovative, experiences very different from the bounce
and rosiness of happy moments. What we want, in short, is a life and a self that happiness
is a fitting response to &mdash; and then to give it that response."

"Always preach the gospel; use words, if necessary."

"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards."
&mdash; [S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard)  

"Equity bids us to be merciful to the weakness of human nature; to think less about
what he said than about what he meant; not to consider the actions of the accused so
much as his intentions, nor this or that detail so much as the whole story."
&mdash; [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)

"If you don't get this elementary, but mildly unnatural, mathematics of elementary
probability into your repertoire, then you go through a long life like a one-legged man in
an ass-kicking contest." &mdash; [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger), 
in a 1994 speech to students at USC, quoted in 
[_ValueWalk_](https://www.valuewalk.com/2016/01/charlie-munger-are-you-a-one-legged-investor-in-a-butt-kicking-contest/).
He's speaking of 
[some letters exchanged between Pascal & Fermat](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/pascal.pdf), 
working out the basics of probability in gambling.  

"It's important in life and in investing always to question yourself. Understand that you
may be wrong, especially when you believe too firmly that you're right."
