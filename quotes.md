["Logic of Empire" (1941)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_Empire))  

"What is true is already so.  
Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.  
Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.

Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived.  
People can stand what is true,  
for they are already enduring it." &mdash; [Eugene Gendlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin)

"&hellip; if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a fact about your own state of mind, not
a fact about the phenomenon itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact
about whatever you were uncertain about; that ignorance existed in the mind, not in
reality; that a blank map did not correspond to a blank territory. There were mysterious
questions, but a mysterious answer was a contradiction in terms." 
&mdash; [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky), channelling 
ET Jaynes in 
[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality)

## The Religious  

"Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime; therefore, we are saved by hope. 
Nothing true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; 
therefore, we are saved by faith.  Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished
alone; therefore, we are saved by love."  &mdash; Reinhold Niebuhr  

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." &mdash; Phillip K
Dick

they call me a communist." &mdash; Dom Helder Camara, archbishop of Recife and apostle of social

that is not gold." &mdash; Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoy  

"Believe nothing, no matter where you read it or who has said it, not even if I have said
it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense." &mdash; Buddha  

"Once for all, then, a short precept is given you: Love, and do what you will:
whether you hold your peace, through love hold your peace; whether you cry out,
through love cry out; whether you correct, through love correct; whether you spare,
through love do you spare: let the root of love be within, of this root can nothing
spring but what is good. &mdash; 
[St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo),
[Homily 7 on 1 John](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170207.htm)  

"Niebuhr was a critic of national innocence, which he regarded as a
delusion. &hellip; &lsquo;Nations, as individuals, who are completely innocent in
their own esteem,&rsquo; Niebuhr wrote, &lsquo;are insufferable in their human
contacts.&rsquo; The self-righteous delusion of innocence encouraged a kind of
Manichaeism dividing the world between good (us) and evil (our critics)."
&mdash; [Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_M._Schlesinger,_Jr.), in 
["Forgetting Reinhold Niebuhr"](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/books/review/forgetting-reinhold-niebuhr.html), 
a NYT essay on why American conservative religious hysteria ignores 
[Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr),
perhaps one of the 20th century's greatest theologians  

"Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man's inclination to
injustice makes democracy necessary." &mdash; 
[Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr)  

"It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers.  That is
false: tragically false.  Look for yourself.  This is the concentration camp and
crematorium at Auschwitz.  This is where people were turned into numbers.  Into this
pond were flushed the ashes of four million people.  And that was not done by gas.  It
was done by arrogance.  It was done by dogma.  It was done by ignorance.  When people
believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality &mdash; this is how
they behave.  This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods&hellip;
In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of
Christ: Think it possible you may be mistaken.'" &mdash; Jacob Bronowski, _The Ascent of
Man_  

"They lied to you. The Devil is not the Prince of Matter; the Devil is the arrogance of
the spirit, faith without smile, truth that is never seized by doubt. The Devil is grim
because he knows where he is going, and, in moving, he always returns whence he came."
&mdash; [Umberto Eco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco), _The Name of the Rose_  

"Adam was but human &mdash; this explains it all. He did not want the apple for the apple's
sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the
serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent." 
&mdash; [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_twain)  

"Faith is something more to be struggled with than had." &mdash; Jeremy Ahouse  

"Doubt isn't the opposite of faith; it is an element of faith."
&mdash; [Paul Tillich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich)  

"Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other
parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the stars and even their sizes and
distances,&hellip;  and this knowledge he holds with certainty from reason and
experience. It is thus offensive and disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian
talk nonsense about such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in
Scripture. We should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, lest
the unbeliever see only ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn."
&mdash; [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo), 
_De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim_ (_The Literal Meaning of Genesis_)  

"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense,
reason, and intellect has intended us to forego their use."
&mdash; [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei)  

"&hellip; some are guilty, but all are responsible." 
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)

"When I was young, I used to admire intelligent people; as I grow older, I admire
kind people." 
&mdash; [Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel)
